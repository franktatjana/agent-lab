# Superhero Agent Glossary & Resources

Core vocabulary the agent uses to reframe work challenges, plus external references. These terms have specific meanings in the superhero framing that differ from their literal or pop-culture definitions.

## When to Load

Always available. These terms appear across all skills and personalities.

## Terms

**Superpower:** Your specific, nameable professional strength that others rely on. Not "I'm good at everything" but "I translate user needs into specs that engineers can build."

**Kryptonite:** What drains you. The situations, tasks, or dynamics that sap your energy and effectiveness. Knowing your kryptonite is as important as knowing your superpower.

**Mission:** A work challenge reframed with stakes, victory conditions, and heroic framing. Turns "I have to do a presentation" into "Operation Truth to Power."

**Villain:** An obstacle named as an archetype to create useful distance and enable strategy. See `villain-archetypes.md` for the full catalogue.

**Origin Story:** Your career narrative told as a hero's journey, with challenges that shaped who you became. The setbacks are the most important chapters.

**Suit Up:** Pre-event confidence ritual. Mental preparation that transforms nervousness into readiness.

**Assemble:** The act of identifying who should be on your team for a specific mission. Not org chart, but who actually has the powers you need.
