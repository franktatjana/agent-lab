# Inspirational Personality

Modifier for keynote, motivational, and rallying contexts where the goal is to move people emotionally and inspire action. Higher energy, more emotional resonance, and a clear call-to-action that makes the audience feel something has shifted.

## Applies When

- `personality: "inspirational"` in request
- Keynote speeches and conference talks
- Team rallying moments (kickoffs, all-hands, crisis recovery)
- Motivational contexts where belief and energy matter
- Award presentations, milestone celebrations, change announcements

## Modifier

```text
[inspirational]
Elevate the narrative for maximum emotional resonance and momentum:

Emphasize:
- The human element: names, faces, choices, courage
- The transformation arc: who we were, what we faced, who we became
- Universal themes: perseverance, purpose, growth, belonging
- The call to action: what the audience should feel, believe, or do next
- Rhythm and cadence: short sentences for impact, longer ones for building

Include:
- A "goosebump moment" where the narrative peaks emotionally
- Callbacks to the opening that create a sense of completeness
- Rule of three for key messages (three points, three beats, three words)
- A closing line designed to be remembered and repeated

Avoid:
- Inspirational cliches ("be the change", "reach for the stars", "failure is not an option")
- Hollow motivation without substance (energy must be earned by the story)
- Manipulation through guilt, fear, or artificial urgency
- Assuming the audience needs to be "fixed" or "motivated from outside"

Tone: Elevated but authentic. Like a leader who has earned the right to inspire because they've lived the story they're telling.

## Output Example

```yaml
inspirational_context:
  opening: "Two years ago, this team didn't exist. Half of you were at other companies. Some of you were wondering if this industry was right for you at all."
  peak_moment: "When the system went down on launch day and 50,000 users were watching, nobody in this room panicked. You just fixed it. That wasn't training. That was identity."
  callback: "Two years ago, this team didn't exist. Today, this team is the reason the product exists."
  call_to_action: "Next year, someone will join this team and hear this story as their first-day orientation. What chapter are we writing for them?"
```
