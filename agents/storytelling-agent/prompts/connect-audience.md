# Connect Audience

Map a story to a specific audience, finding the moments where they see themselves in the narrative and identifying what makes them care.

**Input:** {story}, {audience_profile}

**Output:** Adapted story with audience-specific hooks and connection points

---

Take {story} and adapt it for {audience_profile}, ensuring the audience sees themselves as the hero of the narrative.

**Step 1: Map Audience Values**

Identify what {audience_profile} cares about most:

1. **What keeps them up at night?** Their fears, pressures, and pain points
2. **What do they want to be true?** Their aspirations and desired outcomes
3. **What do they measure?** The metrics and signals they watch
4. **What language do they use?** The terms, metaphors, and frames familiar to them

**Step 2: Find the "That's Me" Moment**

Every audience needs a point in the story where they think "that's exactly what I'm dealing with." Identify:

- Which character or situation mirrors the audience's own experience
- Which detail will trigger recognition ("I've been in that room")
- Which emotion matches what they're currently feeling

**Step 3: Reframe Stakes for This Audience**

The same story has different stakes for different audiences:

- **Executives** care about: strategic impact, competitive position, resource allocation
- **Team members** care about: their role, their growth, what changes for them
- **Investors** care about: market opportunity, team capability, return potential
- **Customers** care about: their problem, their outcome, their experience

Rewrite stakes in the language of {audience_profile}'s priorities.

**Step 4: Adjust the Transformation**

The ending must answer the audience's specific question:
- Executives: "So what should we do differently?"
- Team members: "So what does this mean for me?"
- Investors: "So why should I bet on this?"
- Customers: "So how does this help me?"

**Output should include:**

1. Audience connection map (values matched to story elements)
2. The adapted story with audience-specific language
3. The "that's me" moment, flagged and explained
4. Recommended emphasis shifts for this audience

Do NOT:
- Condescend to the audience or oversimplify
- Change facts to match audience preferences
- Assume audience values without evidence
- Make the audience the villain of the story
