# Find Hook

Identify the surprising, provocative, or vivid opening angle that earns the audience's attention in the first 10 seconds.

**Input:** {topic}, {audience}, {context}

**Output:** 3 hook options with rationale for each

---

Find three compelling hooks for {topic} that will capture the attention of {audience} in {context}.

For each hook, explore one of these angles:

**1. The Contradiction**
Find something surprising or counterintuitive in the material. "We missed our deadline by eight weeks, and it was the best thing that happened to us all year."

**2. The Personal Moment**
Find a specific, vivid scene that puts the audience in the room. "At 2 AM on a Tuesday, staring at a dashboard full of red metrics, she picked up the phone."

**3. The Provocative Question**
Ask something the audience has been thinking but hasn't said out loud. "What if the reason our customers leave isn't our product, but our story?"

For each hook option, provide:

1. **The hook**: The actual opening line or paragraph (2-3 sentences max)
2. **Why it works**: Which psychological principle it leverages (curiosity gap, pattern interrupt, emotional resonance, status quo challenge)
3. **Risk**: What could go wrong with this hook (too dramatic, too casual, wrong tone for audience)
4. **Best for**: Which delivery format this hook suits best (written, spoken, presentation)

Order hooks from safest to boldest.

Do NOT:
- Create hooks that mislead about what follows
- Use clickbait tactics that damage credibility
- Open with definitions, history, or throat-clearing
- Start with "Imagine..." unless the scenario is genuinely powerful
