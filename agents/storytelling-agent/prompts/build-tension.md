# Build Tension

Create escalation and stakes within a narrative, ensuring the audience feels the weight of the conflict before the resolution arrives.

**Input:** {narrative_elements}, {stakes}

**Output:** Tension arc with escalation points

---

Take {narrative_elements} and build a tension arc around {stakes}.

**Identify the Core Conflict**

Every story needs a "but" or a "therefore," never an "and then." Map the conflict:

1. **What was expected?** The plan, the assumption, the status quo.
2. **What actually happened?** The disruption, the failure, the surprise.
3. **What was at risk?** The consequences of failure: money, reputation, relationships, time.

**Build the Escalation**

Tension rises through a sequence, not a single event. Create 3-4 escalation beats:

- **Beat 1**: First sign of trouble. Manageable. "We can handle this."
- **Beat 2**: The problem deepens. Options narrow. "This is harder than we thought."
- **Beat 3**: The stakes become personal or existential. "If we don't solve this, we lose X."
- **Beat 4** (optional): The darkest moment before the turn. "We were out of options."

**Use "But" and "Therefore" Turns**

- BAD (and then): "We launched. And then we got feedback. And then we iterated."
- GOOD (but/therefore): "We launched. But the feedback revealed a problem we hadn't seen. Therefore, we had to rethink our entire approach."

**Calibrate for Context**

- **Business presentation**: Tension comes from business risk, competitive pressure, opportunity cost
- **Personal narrative**: Tension comes from doubt, conflict, difficult choices
- **Data story**: Tension comes from what the numbers reveal vs. what was expected

**Pacing Notes**

For each escalation beat, note:
- How much time to spend here (in a 5-minute story, each beat gets 30-45 seconds)
- What specific detail makes this beat concrete
- Where to pause and let the audience feel the weight

Do NOT:
- Manufacture tension that doesn't exist in the source material
- Escalate beyond what the resolution can pay off
- Use cliffhangers in professional contexts (audiences need to trust you)
