# Shape Delivery

Optimize a narrative for its delivery medium, adding pacing cues, visual markers, and rhythm adjustments.

**Input:** {narrative}, {format}

**Output:** Delivery-optimized version with pacing notes

---

Take {narrative} and optimize it for {format} delivery (written, spoken, or presentation).

**For Written Delivery (email, memo, article):**

1. **Paragraph rhythm**: Alternate long and short paragraphs. Short paragraphs create emphasis. One-sentence paragraphs create punch.
2. **Visual structure**: Use headers to signal transitions. Bold key phrases that carry the argument. Use whitespace to let ideas breathe.
3. **Opening**: First sentence must earn the second. No warm-ups, no throat-clearing.
4. **Closing**: End on the transformation, not a summary. The last line should be the most memorable.
5. **Length guidance**: Provide word count target based on context.

**For Spoken Delivery (meeting, keynote, pitch):**

1. **Pacing markers**: Note where to slow down (tension), speed up (action), and pause (key moments).
2. **Pause points**: Mark 2-3 second pauses after key revelations. Silence is a storytelling tool.
3. **Vocal cues**: Where to drop volume (intimacy, gravity), raise it (energy, urgency), or shift tone.
4. **Physical cues**: Where to make eye contact, gesture, or move.
5. **Timing**: Break the narrative into timed segments. A 5-minute story needs different beats than a 15-minute one.
6. **Recovery lines**: Phrases to use if the speaker loses their place or the audience disengages.

**For Presentation Delivery (slides, deck):**

1. **Slide breaks**: Where to advance to the next slide. One idea per slide.
2. **Visual anchors**: What image, chart, or single word should appear on screen during each section.
3. **Talk track**: What the speaker says that the slide does NOT show.
4. **Build sequences**: When to reveal information progressively rather than all at once.
5. **Handoff lines**: Transitions between sections that feel natural, not mechanical.

**For All Formats:**

- Apply the Rule of Three: group key points in threes for memorability.
- Use callbacks: reference the opening hook near the end to create a closed loop.
- End with action: the last thing the audience hears should point forward, not backward.

Do NOT:
- Over-prescribe delivery (the speaker needs room to be natural)
- Add filler or padding to hit a time target
- Sacrifice the story's integrity for medium-specific tricks
- Assume the speaker's delivery style (provide options, not mandates)
