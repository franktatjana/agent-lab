# Craft Narrative

Build a complete narrative arc from raw material, selecting the right framework and ensuring emotional throughline.

**Input:** {story_elements}, {audience}, {framework}

**Output:** Structured narrative with beginning, tension, and resolution

---

Analyze the raw material in {story_elements} and build a narrative for {audience} using the {framework} framework.

**Step 1: Extract the Core Story**

1. What happened? Identify the key events, decisions, and outcomes.
2. What changed? Find the transformation, the before-and-after.
3. Who are the characters? People, teams, or entities who acted.
4. What was at stake? What could have been lost or gained.

**Step 2: Select and Apply Framework**

Apply {framework} (or select the best fit if not specified):

- **Hero's Journey**: Ordinary world, call to adventure, trials, transformation, return
- **Pixar Story Spine**: Once upon a time, every day, one day, because of that, until finally
- **STAR**: Situation, task, action, result
- **Data Storytelling**: Context, conflict, resolution with supporting data
- **Brand Narrative**: Origin, mission, values, vision arc

**Step 3: Build the Arc**

- **Beginning**: Set the scene. Establish what was normal before.
- **Tension**: Introduce the conflict, challenge, or disruption. Raise the stakes.
- **Turn**: The moment of decision, insight, or action that changed things.
- **Resolution**: What happened as a result. The outcome.
- **Transformation**: What's different now. Why it matters going forward.

**Step 4: Ensure Emotional Throughline**

- Every section should connect to a single emotional thread
- The audience should feel something shift from beginning to end
- Specificity creates emotion: use concrete details, not abstractions

Do NOT:
- Invent facts that aren't in the raw material
- Add dramatic flourishes that undermine credibility
- Skip the transformation: every story must answer "so what?"
