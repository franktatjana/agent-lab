# Origin Story Example
# Skill: Craft a personal or company origin story for branding

input:
  topic: "Company founding story for redesigned website"
  audience: "Potential customers and prospective employees"
  origin_elements: |
    Founded in 2021 by two former teachers, Elena and Marcus. Both left teaching
    after 10+ years because the administrative burden made it impossible to
    actually teach. Spent evenings and weekends building a tool to automate
    lesson planning, grading, and parent communication. First version was a
    spreadsheet they shared with 5 teacher friends. Friends shared it with their
    schools. Within 6 months, 200 teachers were using it. Quit their jobs in
    2022. Now serving 15,000 teachers across 400 schools. Still build every
    feature by asking: "Would this have helped us teach better?"
  context: "About page on company website"
  values: "Teacher-first design, simplicity over features, respect for educators' time"

output:
  narrative_framework: "Brand Narrative (origin, mission, values, vision), selected because this is an identity story connecting founding to purpose"

  story_elements:
    defining_moment: "The evening Elena realized she'd spent 4 hours on administrative tasks and zero hours preparing the lesson she was excited to teach"
    struggle: "Two educators who loved teaching but were drowning in everything around teaching"
    insight: "The tools built for teachers weren't built by teachers. They solved administrator problems, not classroom problems."
    mission: "Give teachers their time back so they can do what they became teachers to do"
    present: "15,000 teachers across 400 schools, still guided by one question: Would this have helped us teach better?"

  brand_throughline: "Built by teachers who missed teaching. Every feature exists because an educator needed it, not because a product manager spec'd it."

  narrative: |
    Elena spent a Tuesday evening the way she spent most Tuesday evenings: not
    preparing for Wednesday's lesson, but filling out compliance forms, updating
    grade spreadsheets, and drafting parent emails about the upcoming field trip.
    Four hours of work that had nothing to do with why she became a teacher.

    Down the hall, Marcus was doing the same thing. Ten years of teaching, and
    the part he loved, the actual teaching, kept shrinking. The paperwork kept
    growing. The tools the school provided were built for administrators, not
    educators. They tracked data upward. They didn't help anyone in the classroom.

    So they started building. Evenings and weekends, working from Elena's kitchen
    table, they created the tool they wished they'd had: one that automated the
    busywork so teachers could spend their time on students. The first version
    was a spreadsheet. They shared it with five teacher friends.

    Those five friends shared it with their schools. Within six months, 200
    teachers were using a tool that two educators had built because they were
    tired of not teaching.

    In 2022, Elena and Marcus left the classroom to build this full-time. Not
    because they wanted to leave teaching, but because they realized the best
    way to help teachers was to fix the system that was stealing their time.

    Today, 15,000 teachers across 400 schools use what started on that kitchen
    table. We still build every feature the same way: we ask, "Would this have
    helped us teach better?" If the answer isn't yes, we don't build it.

    We're not a tech company that chose education. We're educators who learned
    to build technology. That difference shapes every decision we make.

  delivery_notes:
    - "Lead with Elena's Tuesday evening. Specificity makes it real."
    - "The '200 teachers from a spreadsheet' detail is powerful social proof through narrative"
    - "Close on identity, not metrics. 'Educators who learned to build technology' is the line to remember."
    - "For the website, break this into shorter paragraphs with pull quotes"
    - "Consider a companion version for investor contexts that leads with traction"

  confidence: "high"

  caveats:
    - "Confirm Elena and Marcus are comfortable with their names being used publicly"
    - "Adjust teacher count and school numbers to current figures before publishing"
    - "Prospective employees and customers respond to different parts of this story; consider audience-specific versions"
