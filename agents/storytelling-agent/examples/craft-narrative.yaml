# Craft Narrative Example
# Skill: Build a complete narrative arc from raw material

input:
  topic: "How our customer support team saved a $500K account"
  audience: "Company all-hands, 150 people"
  context: "Quarterly recognition presentation"
  raw_material: |
    Our largest enterprise customer, Meridian Corp, opened 47 support tickets in
    one week after a platform update broke their integration. Their CTO emailed
    our CEO directly saying "we're evaluating alternatives." Support lead Priya
    noticed the pattern on Monday morning. By Tuesday she had assembled a
    dedicated 3-person team. They resolved 40 of 47 tickets by Thursday. On
    Friday, Priya flew to Meridian's office with the engineering lead. By the
    following Monday, all issues were resolved and Meridian signed a 2-year
    renewal at 20% higher contract value. The CTO sent a note saying "your
    response was the reason we stayed."
  framework: "Hero's Journey"

output:
  narrative_framework: "Hero's Journey, selected because the story has a clear protagonist (Priya), a genuine crisis, and a transformation"

  story_elements:
    hook: "47 support tickets in one week. One email from a CTO that said three words: 'evaluating alternatives.' That's how close we came to losing our largest customer."
    stakes: "$500K annual contract, our largest enterprise account, and the credibility of our support organization"
    tension: "Every day that passed with unresolved tickets pushed Meridian closer to the exit. The clock was running."
    resolution: "40 of 47 tickets resolved by Thursday. A Friday flight to Meridian's office. All issues closed by Monday."
    transformation: "Meridian didn't just stay. They renewed for two years at 20% higher value. The CTO wrote: 'Your response was the reason we stayed.'"

  narrative: |
    On Monday morning, Priya opened her dashboard and saw something she'd never
    seen before: 47 open tickets from a single customer. Not a trickle of issues.
    A flood. She pulled up the account. Meridian Corp. Our largest enterprise
    customer.

    Then she saw the email thread. Meridian's CTO had written directly to our CEO
    the night before. Three words that changed the week: "evaluating alternatives."

    Priya had a choice. Route the tickets through normal process, estimated
    resolution time: two weeks. Or treat this as what it was, an emergency that
    could cost us $500K and our reputation in enterprise.

    By Tuesday morning, she had pulled two of her best engineers off other work
    and built a dedicated Meridian response team. They triaged all 47 tickets,
    identified the root cause, a platform update that broke Meridian's custom
    integration, and started fixing.

    By Thursday night, 40 of 47 tickets were resolved. But Priya knew that
    closing tickets wasn't enough. Trust doesn't rebuild through a ticketing
    system.

    Friday morning, she and our engineering lead flew to Meridian's office.
    They sat with Meridian's team, walked through every remaining issue
    face-to-face, and committed to a prevention plan so it wouldn't happen again.

    By Monday, all 47 tickets were closed. But here's what happened next: Meridian
    didn't just stay. They signed a two-year renewal at 20% higher contract value.
    Their CTO sent a note that said, "Your response was the reason we stayed."

    Priya didn't save an account. She proved what kind of company we are when it
    matters most.

  alternative_angles:
    - "Tell it from Meridian's CTO perspective: what they expected vs. what they got"
    - "Tell it as a systems story: what broke, why it broke, what we built to prevent it"
    - "Tell it as a team story: the three engineers who dropped everything"

  delivery_notes:
    - "Name Priya early. Heroes need names."
    - "Read the CTO's 'evaluating alternatives' slowly. Let the room feel what that means."
    - "The flight to Meridian's office is the emotional peak. Emphasize the choice to go in person."
    - "End on 'what kind of company we are,' not on the dollar amount."
    - "Keep total presentation under 4 minutes. The story is tight enough."

  confidence: "high"

  caveats:
    - "Confirm with Priya that she's comfortable being named publicly"
    - "Verify Meridian is comfortable with the story being told internally"
