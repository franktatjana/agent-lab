# Data Storytelling Example
# Skill: Turn data and metrics into compelling narratives

input:
  topic: "Q2 customer churn analysis"
  audience: "Board of directors, quarterly review"
  data: |
    Overall churn: 14% (up from 9% last quarter)
    Enterprise churn: 3% (unchanged)
    Mid-market churn: 18% (up from 11%)
    SMB churn: 22% (up from 14%)
    NPS among retained customers: 61 (up from 54)
    Top churn reason (exit surveys): "Outgrew the product" (43%)
    Second reason: "Pricing" (28%)
    Third reason: "Switched to competitor" (17%)
    New feature adoption among retained customers: 78%
    Customer lifetime value (retained): up 23% YoY
  context: "Board is concerned about the headline churn number. CEO wants to present a clear picture, not a defensive one."

output:
  narrative_framework: "Data Storytelling (context, conflict, resolution)"

  story_elements:
    context: "Q2 churn hit 14%, the highest in two years. That headline number is real, and it deserves a serious look."
    conflict: "But the story inside the number is more specific than the number itself. Our enterprise customers, the segment that drives 70% of revenue, churn at 3%, unchanged. The churn is concentrated in SMB and mid-market, and the top reason isn't dissatisfaction. It's 'outgrew the product.'"
    resolution: "We have a retention problem in one segment for one reason: customers who succeed with us eventually need more than we offer. The fix is a growth tier, not a rescue plan."
    supporting_data:
      - "14% overall churn (up from 9%)"
      - "3% enterprise churn (stable)"
      - "43% of churned customers left because they 'outgrew the product'"
      - "NPS among retained customers: 61 (up from 54)"
      - "Customer lifetime value (retained): up 23% YoY"

  data_integration:
    - data_point: "14% overall churn"
      narrative_role: "hook"
      framing: "Open with the headline number. Don't hide from it."
    - data_point: "3% enterprise churn, unchanged"
      narrative_role: "tension (reframe)"
      framing: "Contrast with overall number to show the problem is segment-specific"
    - data_point: "43% churned because they 'outgrew the product'"
      narrative_role: "tension (insight)"
      framing: "The most important data point. Reframes churn as a product gap, not a quality problem."
    - data_point: "NPS 61, up from 54"
      narrative_role: "proof"
      framing: "Customers who stay are happier than ever. The product isn't failing."
    - data_point: "CLV up 23% YoY"
      narrative_role: "resolution"
      framing: "Retained customers are worth more. We're losing the wrong segment, not losing quality."

  narrative: |
    Let me start with the number you're all looking at. Q2 churn hit 14%, up
    from 9% last quarter. That's the highest in two years, and it's worth
    understanding, not explaining away.

    Here's what's inside that number. Our enterprise segment, which drives 70%
    of revenue, churns at 3%. Unchanged from last quarter. Unchanged from last
    year. Enterprise customers stay, and they spend more: lifetime value is up
    23% year over year.

    The churn is concentrated in mid-market and SMB. And when we look at why
    they leave, the exit surveys tell a surprising story. The top reason, at
    43%, isn't "bad product" or "poor service." It's "outgrew the product."

    Read that again. Our most common churn reason is that customers succeed
    with us, grow, and then need capabilities we don't offer yet. They're not
    leaving because we failed. They're leaving because they graduated.

    Meanwhile, the customers who stay are happier than ever. NPS rose from 54
    to 61. Feature adoption among retained customers hit 78%.

    So here's the picture: we have a product that delights customers and then
    loses them when they scale. That's not a retention crisis. That's a product
    tier gap. The recommendation is to build a growth tier that captures these
    customers at the moment they're most convinced we're valuable, not after
    they've started looking elsewhere.

  delivery_notes:
    - "Start with 14% and own it. Boards respect honesty more than spin."
    - "The 43% 'outgrew' stat is the turning point. Pause and let the reframe land."
    - "NPS and CLV are your credibility anchors. Present them side by side."
    - "End with the recommendation, not with the problem. Boards want to know what's next."
    - "Prepare a one-slide visual: churn by segment with reasons, not just the topline number."

  confidence: "high"

  caveats:
    - "Verify that 'outgrew the product' interpretation matches the actual exit survey wording"
    - "Board may challenge whether the growth tier will retain or just delay churn"
    - "Competitor churn (17%) deserves its own follow-up analysis"
