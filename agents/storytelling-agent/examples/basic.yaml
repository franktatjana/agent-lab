# Basic Storytelling Agent Example
# Simplest valid input demonstrating core functionality

input:
  topic: "Why we're changing our product roadmap"
  audience: "Engineering team, 30 people, all-hands meeting"
  context: "Internal presentation"

output:
  narrative_framework: "Pixar Story Spine, selected for compression and causal clarity"

  story_elements:
    hook: "Six months ago, we were building the wrong product. We just didn't know it yet."
    stakes: "12 months of engineering effort aimed at a feature customers didn't want"
    tension: "Customer interviews revealed 80% were using our product for something we hadn't designed it for"
    resolution: "We pivoted the roadmap to match how customers actually use the product"
    transformation: "We're now building what the market is asking for, not what we assumed they'd want"

  narrative: |
    Six months ago, we were building the wrong product. We just didn't know it yet.

    Every sprint, we shipped features from a roadmap designed around our assumptions
    about what customers needed. The backlog was full. Velocity was strong. On paper,
    everything was green.

    Then product ran 40 customer interviews. The results stopped us cold: 80% of our
    users were ignoring the features we'd prioritized and using our product for
    something we hadn't even designed. We were building a Swiss Army knife. They
    wanted a scalpel.

    Because of that, we made a hard call. We scrapped three months of planned work
    and rebuilt the roadmap around actual usage patterns. It wasn't easy. It meant
    killing features people here had invested real time in.

    Until finally, the new roadmap launched. First month: engagement on core features
    up 34%. Support tickets down 20%. Customers started saying "you finally get it."

    We're not changing direction because something is broken. We're changing direction
    because we listened, and what we heard was more valuable than what we assumed.

  delivery_notes:
    - "Open with 'building the wrong product' and pause. Let the discomfort land."
    - "Acknowledge the hard truth: scrapping planned work is painful for the team"
    - "End on the positive shift, not on the mistake"

  confidence: "high"

  caveats:
    - "Adapt specific metrics to actual numbers before presenting"
    - "Engineering teams value honesty about the pivot, don't sugarcoat the change"
