# Pitch Story Example
# Skill: Craft a persuasive narrative for pitches and proposals

input:
  topic: "Series A fundraising for developer productivity tool"
  audience: "Venture capital partners at a growth-stage fund"
  ask: "Invest $8M in our Series A to scale go-to-market"
  context: "30-minute in-person pitch meeting"
  raw_material: |
    Founded 18 months ago by two ex-Stripe engineers who spent 3 hours/day on
    deployment tooling instead of product work. Built an internal tool, colleagues
    asked for it, launched publicly 10 months ago. 2,400 teams now use it. $1.2M
    ARR growing 25% month-over-month. NPS of 72. Average team saves 11 hours/week.
    Zero paid marketing, all word-of-mouth. Competing against tools built 10 years
    ago that require dedicated DevOps teams.
  time_limit: "3 minutes for the narrative portion"

output:
  narrative_framework: "Brand Narrative + Pixar Story Spine, combined for origin credibility and causal momentum"

  story_elements:
    hook: "Every developer we've talked to spends a third of their day not writing code. We know because we were those developers."
    problem: "Engineering teams lose 11+ hours per week to deployment complexity. That's $150K per engineer per year spent on infrastructure busywork."
    solution: "A deployment tool built by engineers who hated the problem enough to solve it, and simple enough that you don't need a DevOps team to use it."
    proof: "2,400 teams. $1.2M ARR. 25% monthly growth. NPS of 72. Zero dollars in marketing."
    transformation: "A world where every engineer ships code, not fights infrastructure."

  call_to_action: "We're raising $8M to turn word-of-mouth traction into a go-to-market engine. We'd like you to be part of that."

  narrative: |
    Two years ago, we were engineers at Stripe. Good engineers, working on important
    problems. And every day, we spent three hours not solving those problems. Instead,
    we were fighting deployment tooling that was built a decade ago for a different
    world.

    So we built something for ourselves. A deployment tool that actually worked the
    way engineers think. No dedicated DevOps team required. No week-long setup. Push
    code, it ships.

    Our colleagues asked for it. Then their friends at other companies asked for it.
    We launched publicly ten months ago with zero marketing budget.

    Today, 2,400 teams use our tool. We're at $1.2M in annual recurring revenue,
    growing 25% month over month. Our NPS is 72. Every one of those customers found
    us through word of mouth. Because when you save an engineering team 11 hours a
    week, they tell people.

    The market we're in is dominated by tools built ten years ago. They're powerful,
    and they require a dedicated team just to operate them. We're building the
    alternative: the tool that doesn't need its own team.

    We're raising $8M to do what our customers have been doing for us: tell the
    story at scale. Sales, marketing, and customer success to match the product
    traction we've already proven.

  delivery_notes:
    - "Open with the personal experience. Investors fund founders who felt the problem."
    - "Hit the traction numbers in sequence: teams, revenue, growth, NPS. Let each one land."
    - "'Zero dollars in marketing' is a punchline. Pause after it."
    - "The ask should feel like an invitation, not a request. 'We'd like you to be part of that.'"
    - "Keep it under 3 minutes. Let the conversation do the rest."

  confidence: "high"

  caveats:
    - "Adjust financial specifics to current numbers before the meeting"
    - "Different funds care about different metrics; emphasize growth for growth-stage, unit economics for later-stage"
