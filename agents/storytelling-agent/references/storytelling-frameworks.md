# Storytelling Frameworks

The theoretical foundation the agent uses to structure narratives. Five frameworks, each serving a different purpose: Hero's Journey for transformation arcs, Pixar Story Spine for compressed narratives, STAR for professional accomplishments, Data Storytelling for evidence-based persuasion, Brand Narrative for identity and positioning.

## When to Load

Load when crafting any narrative, selecting a framework, or coaching someone on story structure. Most skills reference at least one of these frameworks.

## Hero's Journey (Joseph Campbell)

A transformation arc in 12 stages, adapted from mythological storytelling to professional contexts. Best for stories where the protagonist goes through a genuine change and returns different.

### The 12 Stages

**Act 1: Departure**

1. **Ordinary World.** The status quo before the story begins. Establishes what "normal" looks like so the audience feels the disruption when it comes. In professional contexts: the team before the crisis, the company before the pivot, the career before the turning point.

2. **Call to Adventure.** Something disrupts the ordinary world. A problem, an opportunity, a challenge that demands a response. In professional contexts: the market shift, the customer complaint, the failed launch, the unexpected job offer.

3. **Refusal of the Call.** The initial resistance. The reasons it can't work, shouldn't be tried, or isn't the right time. This stage creates relatability because audiences have all hesitated. In professional contexts: "We don't have the budget," "The timing is wrong," "That's not our core business."

4. **Meeting the Mentor.** Someone or something provides the insight, tool, or courage needed to proceed. In professional contexts: the advisor, the data that changed the analysis, the team member who said "what if we..."

5. **Crossing the Threshold.** The point of no return. The decision to act. In professional contexts: the board vote, the first prototype, the email sent.

**Act 2: Initiation**

6. **Tests, Allies, Enemies.** The messy middle where the protagonist faces challenges, finds unexpected supporters, and discovers obstacles. In professional contexts: vendor failures, team dynamics, competitive responses, technical hurdles.

7. **Approach to the Inmost Cave.** Preparation for the biggest challenge. The stakes become clear. In professional contexts: the final sprint before launch, the preparation for the board meeting, the last attempt before the deadline.

8. **The Ordeal.** The central crisis. The darkest moment where failure seems likely. In professional contexts: the system outage, the key employee resignation, the competitor announcement, the budget cut.

9. **The Reward.** What is gained from surviving the ordeal. Not yet the final victory, but the insight, capability, or proof that changes the trajectory. In professional contexts: the breakthrough metric, the working prototype, the customer validation.

**Act 3: Return**

10. **The Road Back.** Applying the reward. Implementation, scaling, integration. In professional contexts: the rollout, the organizational change, the new process.

11. **The Resurrection.** A final test that proves the transformation is real. In professional contexts: the first quarter under the new model, the repeat customer, the successful replication.

12. **Return with the Elixir.** The protagonist returns to the ordinary world, changed, with something valuable to share. In professional contexts: the case study, the lessons learned, the new capability the organization now owns.

### When to Use Hero's Journey

- Keynote speeches and conference talks
- Company transformation stories
- Career arc narratives for interviews or personal branding
- Post-crisis retrospectives where real change occurred
- Any story where the protagonist is genuinely different at the end

### When NOT to Use

- Quick pitches (too long and complex)
- Data-driven presentations (too narrative-heavy)
- Situations where the "transformation" is minor or forced

## Pixar Story Spine

A compressed narrative framework developed at Pixar Animation Studios. Six beats that force narrative causality: every event causes the next, preventing "and then" storytelling.

### The Six Beats

1. **Once upon a time...** The ordinary world. Set the scene with one or two sentences. Who, where, what was normal.

2. **Every day...** The routine. What was habitual, predictable, taken for granted. This establishes the baseline the audience needs to feel the disruption.

3. **One day...** The inciting incident. The thing that changed everything. One specific event, decision, or discovery.

4. **Because of that...** The first consequence. Not "and then" but "because of that," which forces causal connection. One thing leads directly to the next.

5. **Because of that...** The second consequence. Stakes escalate. The initial disruption creates a chain of effects. Repeat this beat as many times as needed to build tension.

6. **Until finally...** The resolution. The chain of consequences reaches a climax and resolves. Something is now permanently different.

**And ever since that day...** (Optional closing beat.) The transformation. What changed permanently. The new normal.

### Professional Application

```
Once upon a time, our team relied on a single vendor for our core infrastructure.
Every day, we processed 10,000 orders through their system without thinking about it.
One day, they announced a 300% price increase effective in 90 days.
Because of that, we had to decide: pay the increase, or build our own system from scratch.
Because of that, our engineering team spent 60 days building what no one thought was possible.
Until finally, we launched our own platform, processing 15,000 orders on day one.
And ever since that day, we've owned our infrastructure and reduced costs by 40%.
```

### When to Use Pixar Story Spine

- Elevator pitches and project proposals
- Team updates and retrospectives
- Any narrative that needs to be compressed to 60-90 seconds
- When teaching someone to structure their first story
- Situations where "and then" storytelling needs to become causal storytelling

### When NOT to Use

- Complex multi-character stories (too compressed)
- Situations requiring detailed analysis (too narrative-focused)
- When the audience expects formal structure (may feel too casual)

## STAR Stories (Situation, Task, Action, Result)

A four-part framework designed for professional accomplishment narratives. Originally developed for behavioral interviews, STAR works anywhere you need to demonstrate competence through specific examples.

### The Four Parts

1. **Situation.** Set the context. When and where did this happen? What were the conditions? Be specific: "In Q2 2024, our customer churn hit 18%, the highest in company history" is stronger than "We had a retention problem."

2. **Task.** Define your responsibility. What were you specifically accountable for? What was expected? This clarifies your role and prevents the "we did everything" trap. "I was asked to diagnose the root cause and propose a fix within 30 days."

3. **Action.** Describe what you did. Not what the team did generally, but your specific choices and behaviors. Use "I" not "we" for the actions that were yours. "I interviewed 40 churned customers in two weeks and discovered that 70% cited the same onboarding gap."

4. **Result.** Quantify the outcome. What changed? Use numbers, percentages, timeframes. "Churn dropped to 9% within one quarter. The onboarding fix we implemented became the company standard."

### Professional Examples

**Interview context:**
- Situation: "Our largest client threatened to leave after a product outage."
- Task: "As account lead, I needed to retain the $2M relationship within 48 hours."
- Action: "I flew to their office, presented a root cause analysis, and proposed a service-level guarantee with penalty clauses."
- Result: "They renewed for three years at 15% higher contract value. They cited the response as the reason they stayed."

**Performance review context:**
- Situation: "The sales team was missing quota three quarters in a row."
- Task: "As sales ops lead, I was asked to find and fix the pipeline bottleneck."
- Action: "I audited 200 deals and found that 60% stalled at the proposal stage due to pricing complexity. I redesigned the pricing model to three tiers."
- Result: "Win rate increased from 22% to 38% in one quarter. Revenue grew 28% with no additional headcount."

### When to Use STAR

- Job interviews and behavioral questions
- Performance reviews and promotion cases
- Professional bio writing and LinkedIn summaries
- Mentorship conversations about career development
- Any time you need to demonstrate competence through specific examples

### When NOT to Use

- Brand or company-level storytelling (too individual-focused)
- Inspirational or motivational contexts (too structured, not enough emotion)
- When the audience wants vision, not proof

## Data Storytelling (Context, Conflict, Resolution)

A framework for turning numbers into meaning. Data storytelling doesn't replace analysis; it makes analysis matter by wrapping it in narrative structure that drives decisions.

### The Three Parts

1. **Context.** What was expected, planned, or assumed. The baseline the audience needs to understand the data. "We projected 20% growth in Q3 based on pipeline coverage of 3.2x." Context answers: "Compared to what?"

2. **Conflict.** What the data reveals that challenges the expectation. The gap between plan and reality, the trend that disrupts assumptions, the correlation nobody expected. "Actual growth came in at 8%. But the story isn't the gap, it's the reason. Our enterprise segment grew 32% while mid-market contracted 12%." Conflict answers: "So what?"

3. **Resolution.** What the data suggests should happen next. The action that follows from the conflict. Not a recommendation bolted onto a chart, but an organic conclusion the data builds toward. "The data shows our product-market fit in enterprise is accelerating while our mid-market pricing model is breaking. We recommend reallocating 30% of mid-market resources to enterprise." Resolution answers: "Now what?"

### Data Integration Principles

- **Lead with one number.** Not six charts. One metric that captures the story. "18% churn" is a story. "Revenue of $12.4M against plan of $14.1M with EBITDA margin of 22.3% and..." is a spreadsheet.
- **Contrast creates meaning.** A number alone is not a story. A number compared to a target, a competitor, or a prior period is a story. "4.6 out of 5" means nothing. "4.6 out of 5, up from 3.9 last year" is a story.
- **Sequence creates causality.** Show data in the order that reveals causation, not in the order it was collected. "Churn rose because onboarding satisfaction dropped because we cut the onboarding team" is a story. "We cut the team, and also churn went up, and also satisfaction dropped" is a coincidence.
- **Anomalies are hooks.** The most interesting data point is the one that doesn't fit the pattern. Lead with it.

### When to Use Data Storytelling

- Board meetings and quarterly business reviews
- Research presentations and findings summaries
- Team retrospectives driven by metrics
- Any presentation where the audience will see charts
- Situations where "the data speaks for itself" clearly isn't working

### When NOT to Use

- Personal narratives without data (wrong framework)
- Inspirational moments (data dampens emotion if not handled carefully)
- When the audience wants to explore data interactively (narrative is linear)

## Brand Narrative (Origin, Mission, Values, Vision Arc)

A framework for identity storytelling. Brand narratives connect where you came from to where you're going, creating a through-line that makes the audience want to be part of the story.

### The Four Parts

1. **Origin.** The founding moment. Not just "we were founded in 2015" but the scene, the frustration, the insight that made someone say "this has to exist." Origins are most powerful when they include struggle: the problem the founder experienced personally, the gap they couldn't ignore, the moment they decided to act.

2. **Mission.** What you set out to do about it. The mission connects the origin to the present: "We experienced X, so we built Y." Mission statements in brand narratives are not taglines. They are one-sentence explanations of why you exist. "We make project management software" is a description. "We built the tool we wished we had when our own projects kept failing" is a mission.

3. **Values.** How you do what you do. Values in brand narratives are not wall posters. They are demonstrated through specific choices: "We chose to make our pricing transparent because we hated the 'contact sales' experience ourselves." Values become real when you can point to a decision you made because of them, especially a decision that cost you something.

4. **Vision Arc.** Where the story is going. The vision connects the origin and mission to the future the audience can join. "We started with project management for small teams. We're building toward a world where no project fails because of poor tools." Vision arcs invite the audience to see themselves in the next chapter.

### When to Use Brand Narrative

- Company "About" pages and founding stories
- Investor pitches where identity matters
- Talent recruitment and employer branding
- Internal culture documents and onboarding
- Product launches that need to connect features to purpose

### When NOT to Use

- Tactical communications (too philosophical)
- Data-driven presentations (wrong framing)
- When the brand is genuinely new and has no origin story yet (don't fabricate one)

## Framework Selection Guide

Choosing the right framework matters more than executing any framework perfectly. Use this guide when the situation doesn't obviously point to one framework.

| Situation | Best Framework | Why |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| Keynote or conference talk | Hero's Journey | Audience expects transformation arc |
| Elevator pitch or quick proposal | Pixar Story Spine | Forces compression and causality |
| Job interview or performance review | STAR | Demonstrates competence with specifics |
| Board meeting or quarterly review | Data Storytelling | Evidence-first with narrative structure |
| About page or founder pitch | Brand Narrative | Connects origin to audience aspiration |
| Team retrospective | Pixar or Data | Depends on whether lessons or metrics drive the story |
| Crisis communication | Hero's Journey (compressed) | Shows struggle, decision, and recovery |
| Sales pitch | Brand Narrative + STAR | Origin builds trust, STAR proves capability |
