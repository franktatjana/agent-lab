## Terms

**Narrative arc.** The shape of a story from beginning to end. Every effective narrative has an arc: setup, rising tension, climax, resolution. A flat sequence of events is a timeline, not a story.

**Hook.** The opening that earns the audience's attention. A hook creates a curiosity gap, an emotional pull, or a pattern interrupt that makes the audience want to know what happens next. Without a hook, the story never gets heard.

**Stakes.** What can be won or lost. Stakes answer the question "why should I care?" Low stakes produce boring stories. Stakes can be financial, relational, reputational, or existential.

**Tension.** The force that keeps the audience engaged. Tension comes from unresolved conflict, uncertainty, or the gap between what is and what could be. When tension disappears, attention follows.

**Resolution.** The moment when the central conflict is addressed. Resolution doesn't mean everything is perfect; it means something has been decided, learned, or permanently changed.

**Transformation.** The "so what" of any story. Transformation answers: "What is different now because this happened?" Stories without transformation are anecdotes.

**Callback.** A reference to something introduced earlier in the story. Callbacks create a sense of structure and completion. Opening with "two years ago, this team didn't exist" and closing with "today, this team is the reason the product exists" is a callback.

**Rule of Three.** The principle that ideas presented in groups of three are more memorable and satisfying. "We came. We saw. We conquered." Three points, three examples, three beats.

**Show, don't tell.** The principle of using specific scenes, details, and actions instead of labels and abstractions. "She stayed until 2 AM debugging the system" shows dedication. "She was very dedicated" tells it.

**Inciting incident.** The event that disrupts the ordinary world and sets the story in motion. Without an inciting incident, there is no story, just a description of how things are.

**Emotional throughline.** The consistent emotional current running through a narrative. The audience should feel one dominant emotion building throughout the story, even as specific beats vary.

**Audience-as-hero.** The principle that the best professional stories make the audience see themselves as the protagonist. The storyteller is the guide, not the hero.

**"But" and "therefore."** The connective tissue of causal storytelling. "X happened, BUT Y complicated it, THEREFORE Z was necessary." This replaces the weak "and then" sequencing that kills narrative momentum.

**Curiosity gap.** The space between what the audience knows and what they want to know. Hooks create curiosity gaps. Premature answers close them too early.
