# Storytelling Agent

Narrative crafter for professional contexts. Transforms facts, data, and experiences into stories that move people to action.

## The Human Analogy

Think of the Storytelling Agent as a seasoned communications director who has spent years turning dry quarterly reports into boardroom narratives, coaching executives before keynotes, and helping founders articulate why their company exists. It sees story structure everywhere, finds the hook in any situation, and knows that the same facts can bore or inspire depending on how they're sequenced.

The agent is your narrative architect, not your ghostwriter. It helps you find and shape your story; you own the message and the delivery.

## Value Proposition

**For leaders:** Turn complex business results into narratives your team and board actually remember. Frame setbacks as learning stories, not excuses.

**For salespeople:** Build pitches around customer stories, not feature lists. Make prospects see themselves in the narrative before you ask for the close.

**For career builders:** Shape your experience into origin stories, STAR narratives, and professional arcs that make interviewers, mentors, and sponsors lean forward.

**For presenters:** Transform slide decks from data dumps into narrative journeys. Know where to pause, where to build tension, and where to land the takeaway.

## How to Use

## Problem

Most professionals have good stories but tell them badly. Quarterly reviews become data dumps. Pitches become feature lists. Career conversations become resume recitals. The information is there, but the narrative structure is missing. Without story, facts don't stick, audiences don't care, and action doesn't follow.

## Goals

- Help professionals find the story inside their facts and data
- Provide narrative frameworks that fit professional contexts
- Create stories that are honest, compelling, and audience-aware
- Make storytelling accessible to people who don't think of themselves as storytellers

## Non-Goals

- Replace professional speechwriters for high-profile public events
- Create fictional entertainment content
- Provide marketing or advertising copywriting
- Guarantee specific audience reactions or conversion metrics

## Use Cases

- Presenting project results (successes and failures) to leadership
- Building investor pitch narratives
- Crafting company or personal origin stories
- Turning data and analytics into memorable board presentations
- Preparing keynote or conference talk narratives

## Ideas

- Add framework auto-selection based on audience and context analysis
- Support story-to-slides conversion for presentation agents
- Include a "story bank" for recurring organizational narratives
- Build a coaching mode that teaches storytelling principles through practice

## Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Current):** Core narrative crafting with five frameworks, four delivery skills

**Phase 2:** Multi-format adaptation (one story, multiple outputs), story coaching mode

**Phase 3:** Story bank integration, organizational narrative patterns, real-time presentation coaching

## Open Questions

- How to handle stories where the user is not the protagonist (telling someone else's story)?
- When does narrative framing cross into spin or manipulation?
- How to balance emotional impact with accuracy for data-heavy contexts?

## Success Criteria

- Narratives have clear structure: hook, tension, resolution, transformation
- Users report that audiences responded differently (remembered, acted, engaged)
- Facts are preserved accurately, never distorted for narrative effect
- Framework selection matches the context and audience
