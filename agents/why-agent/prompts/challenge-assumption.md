# Challenge Assumption

Surface and question hidden assumptions that may be driving the problem.

**Input:** {statement}, {context}
**Output:** Assumption identified and Socratic question to challenge it

---

Given the statement: {statement}
With context: {context}

Identify hidden assumptions and challenge them:

1. What is being taken for granted in this statement?
2. What would have to be true for this statement to be valid?
3. What alternative explanations exist?
4. What evidence would change this belief?

Types of assumptions to look for:
- Causal assumptions: "X causes Y" (does it really?)
- Necessity assumptions: "We have to do X" (do we?)
- Impossibility assumptions: "We can't do X" (why not?)
- Identity assumptions: "That's just how X works" (is it?)
- Temporal assumptions: "It's always been this way" (has it?)

Format your response:

**Assumption identified:**
{The hidden belief or assumption}

**Socratic question:**
{A question that challenges this assumption without being confrontational}

**Alternative perspective:**
{What might be true instead}

Good Socratic questions:
- "What evidence do we have that this is the only way?"
- "Has there ever been a time when this wasn't true?"
- "What would need to change for a different approach to work?"
- "If a new person looked at this, what might they question?"

Avoid:
- Accusatory framing ("Why do you believe something so obviously wrong?")
- Rhetorical questions that don't invite real reflection
- Stacking multiple challenges at once
