# Fishbone Analysis Example
# Analyzing why customer support response times are increasing

input:
  problem: "Customer support response time has increased from 4 hours to 12 hours"
  context: "SaaS company, no recent major incidents, team size unchanged"
  personality: "facilitator"
  skill: "fishbone-analysis"

output:
  problem_statement: "Average first response time to customer support tickets has increased from 4 hours to 12 hours over the past quarter, despite no change in team size or major incidents."

    - category: People
      causes:
        - cause: "Two experienced agents left last month"
          likelihood: high
          evidence: "HR records confirm departures; new hires still ramping"
        - cause: "Remaining team feeling overworked and demotivated"
          likelihood: medium
          evidence: "Anecdotal; needs survey data"
        - cause: "New agents lack product knowledge"
          likelihood: medium
          evidence: "Training records show accelerated onboarding"

    - category: Process
      causes:
        - cause: "Ticket routing is inefficient; wrong agents get wrong tickets"
          likelihood: high
          evidence: "30% of tickets get reassigned at least once"
        - cause: "No triage process; all tickets treated equally"
          likelihood: medium
          evidence: "Simple questions wait as long as complex issues"
        - cause: "Escalation process is unclear"
          likelihood: low
          evidence: "Some escalation delays, but not systematic"

    - category: Technology
      causes:
        - cause: "New ticketing system introduced 6 weeks ago"
          likelihood: high
          evidence: "Response times increased shortly after rollout"
        - cause: "Knowledge base search is poor"
          likelihood: medium
          evidence: "Agents report difficulty finding articles"
        - cause: "No automation for common questions"
          likelihood: low
          evidence: "Competitors have chatbots; we don't"

    - category: Environment
      causes:
        - cause: "Holiday season increasing ticket volume"
          likelihood: high
          evidence: "Volume up 40% month-over-month"
        - cause: "Remote work making collaboration harder"
          likelihood: low
          evidence: "Team has been remote for 2 years; not new"

    - category: Materials
      causes:
        - cause: "Documentation for new features is incomplete"
          likelihood: medium
          evidence: "Recent releases had sparse docs"
        - cause: "Customer questions are more complex"
          likelihood: low
          evidence: "No clear trend in complexity"

    - category: Measurement
      causes:
        - cause: "Response time wasn't being measured until recently"
          likelihood: low
          evidence: "We now have data; problem may have existed earlier"
        - cause: "No alerting on queue depth"
          likelihood: medium
          evidence: "Team doesn't see backlog building until it's large"

  drill_down_results:
    - cause: "New ticketing system introduced 6 weeks ago"
      drill:
        - question: "Why is the new system affecting response times?"
          answer: "Interface is slower and agents can't find ticket history easily"
        - question: "Why can't agents find ticket history?"
          answer: "Search function doesn't search previous tickets; only knowledge base"
        - question: "Why wasn't this caught before rollout?"
          answer: "No agent acceptance testing; IT deployed without support team input"
      root_cause: "Ticketing system was deployed without support team input or acceptance testing"

    - cause: "Ticket routing is inefficient"
      drill:
        - question: "Why are tickets going to wrong agents?"
          answer: "Auto-routing rules were copied from old system; don't match new categories"
        - question: "Why weren't rules updated?"
          answer: "Nobody owned the migration of routing rules"
      root_cause: "Routing rules migration had no owner during system transition"

  root_causes:
    - cause: "Ticketing system deployed without support team acceptance testing"
      category: Process / Technology
      confidence: high
      evidence: "Timeline matches; agents confirm usability issues"

    - cause: "Routing rules migration had no owner"
      category: Process
      confidence: high
      evidence: "30% reassignment rate; rules confirmed outdated"

    - cause: "Experienced agent departures during system transition"
      category: People
      confidence: medium
      evidence: "Knowledge gap compounded system issues"
