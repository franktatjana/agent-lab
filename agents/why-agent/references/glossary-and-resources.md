## Terms

**Symptom:** Observable effect of a problem. What you see happening. Not the cause.

**Contributing factor:** Something that makes the problem worse but isn't the root. Fixing it may reduce severity without preventing recurrence.

**Root cause:** The fundamental reason. Fixing it prevents recurrence. If the problem would still happen after your fix, you haven't found it yet.

**5 Whys:** Toyota's technique of asking "why" iteratively (typically 5 times) to drill past symptoms to root causes. See `five-whys-guide.md`.

**Fishbone diagram:** Visual tool (also called Ishikawa) organizing causes into categories (6M). The "head" is the problem, the "bones" are cause categories. See `fishbone-categories.md`.

**A3:** Toyota's one-page problem-solving format, named for the A3 paper size. Forces concise, structured thinking: background, current state, goal, root cause, countermeasures, plan.

**Countermeasure:** Action taken to address a root cause. Not a "solution" (implies permanence), a countermeasure that can be tested, adjusted, or replaced.
