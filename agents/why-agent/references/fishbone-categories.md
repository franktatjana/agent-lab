# Fishbone Categories

Category framework for organizing potential causes in root cause analysis.

## When to Load

- Conducting fishbone analysis
- Brainstorming causes systematically
- Ensuring all cause categories are considered

## The 6M Framework

The classic manufacturing framework, adapted for general use:

### 1. People (Man)

Causes related to human factors.

**Subcategories:**
- Skills and competence
- Training and onboarding
- Communication
- Workload and capacity
- Motivation and engagement
- Roles and responsibilities

**Example causes:**
- "Team member unfamiliar with the process"
- "No one was assigned ownership"
- "Communication breakdown between shifts"
- "Overloaded team took shortcuts"

**Drill deeper with:**
- Why wasn't training provided?
- Why was ownership unclear?
- Why did communication break down?

### 2. Process (Method)

Causes related to procedures, workflows, and ways of working.

**Subcategories:**
- Standard procedures
- Workflows and handoffs
- Documentation
- Change management
- Quality checks
- Approval processes

**Example causes:**
- "No documented procedure for this scenario"
- "Handoff between teams failed"
- "Process skipped under time pressure"
- "Checklist didn't include this step"

**Drill deeper with:**
- Why doesn't a procedure exist?
- Why did the handoff fail?
- Why was the process skippable?

### 3. Technology (Machine)

Causes related to tools, systems, and equipment.

**Subcategories:**
- Hardware and equipment
- Software and applications
- Infrastructure
- Integrations and APIs
- Monitoring and alerting
- Maintenance

**Example causes:**
- "System didn't have validation for this input"
- "Tool doesn't support this workflow"
- "Monitoring didn't detect the failure"
- "Integration between systems broke"

**Drill deeper with:**
- Why doesn't the system validate?
- Why was this workflow not supported?
- Why wasn't monitoring in place?

### 4. Environment (Mother Nature)

Causes related to context, conditions, and external factors.

**Subcategories:**
- Physical environment
- Organizational culture
- External pressures (market, regulatory)
- Dependencies on external parties
- Timing and circumstances

**Example causes:**
- "Peak load exceeded capacity"
- "Culture discourages raising concerns"
- "Vendor dependency created bottleneck"
- "Deadline pressure led to shortcuts"

**Drill deeper with:**
- Why wasn't capacity planned for peak?
- Why does culture discourage concerns?
- Why are we dependent on this vendor?

### 5. Materials (Input)

Causes related to inputs, data, and dependencies.

**Subcategories:**
- Data quality
- Input validation
- Upstream dependencies
- Resource availability
- Documentation and specifications

**Example causes:**
- "Input data was malformed"
- "Requirements were incomplete"
- "Upstream system provided stale data"
- "Specification was ambiguous"

**Drill deeper with:**
- Why wasn't input validated?
- Why were requirements incomplete?
- Why was the specification ambiguous?

### 6. Measurement

Causes related to metrics, monitoring, and feedback.

**Subcategories:**
- Metrics and KPIs
- Monitoring and alerting
- Testing and validation
- Feedback loops
- Visibility and reporting

**Example causes:**
- "No metrics tracked for this area"
- "Alert thresholds were set wrong"
- "No test covered this scenario"
- "Feedback from users wasn't collected"

**Drill deeper with:**
- Why isn't this measured?
- Why were thresholds misconfigured?
- Why wasn't this scenario tested?

## Alternative Frameworks

### 4Ps (Service Industry)
- **Policies**: Rules and guidelines
- **Procedures**: How work is done
- **People**: Human factors
- **Plant/Technology**: Tools and systems

### 8Ps (Extended Service)
- Product, Price, Place, Promotion
- People, Process, Physical Evidence, Productivity

### 4S (Simplified)
- **Systems**: Technology and tools
- **Skills**: Human capability
- **Structure**: Organization and process
- **Strategy**: Direction and priorities

## Using Categories Effectively

### Don't force fit
If a cause doesn't fit a category well, create "Other" or question the category structure.

### Causes can span categories
"No training on the new system" involves People (training) and Technology (new system). Assign to primary category, note the connection.

### Empty categories are informative
If a category has no causes, ask: Are we blind to this area? Or is it genuinely not a factor?

### Prioritize after brainstorming
Capture all causes first, then prioritize by likelihood and evidence.

## Integration

**With 5 Whys**: Use fishbone to identify potential causes, then 5 Whys to drill into each.

**With A3**: Fishbone provides the "Analysis" visual; root causes feed into "Countermeasures."

**With Systems Thinking**: If causes are interconnected with feedback loops, consider systems analysis.
