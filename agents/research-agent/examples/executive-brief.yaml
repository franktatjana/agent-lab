  # Research: AI Agent Security Vulnerabilities

  ## Key Findings
  - Prompt injection remains the top attack vector (78% of reported incidents)
  - Tool-use agents have expanded attack surface vs. chat-only systems
  - Authentication and authorization gaps in multi-agent systems
  - Data exfiltration via unmonitored tool outputs
  - Insufficient input validation at agent boundaries

  ## Confidence: high

  ## Sources
  1. [OWASP LLM Top 10](https://owasp.org/...): Security framework
  2. [Anthropic Safety Research](https://anthropic.com/...): Attack taxonomy

  ## Gaps
  - Limited data on production incident rates
