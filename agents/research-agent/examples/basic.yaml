  summary: |
    Context engineering involves curating what information enters an LLM's
    context window to maximize task performance within token limits. Key
    practices include strategic ordering (critical instructions first and last),
    using structured formats like XML or JSON for clarity, and filtering for
    relevance to prevent attention dilution.

  key_points:
    - "Ordering matters: critical instructions go first and last"
    - "Structured formats (XML, JSON) help parsing"
    - "Relevance filtering prevents attention dilution"
    - "Dynamic assembly based on runtime needs improves efficiency"

  sources:
    - url: "https://example.com/context-engineering"
      relevance: "Primary source on ordering strategies"
    - url: "https://example.com/prompt-structure"
      relevance: "Detailed examples of structured formats"

  confidence: "high"

  gaps:
    - "Limited information on context budget optimization"
    - "Few benchmarks comparing different ordering strategies"
