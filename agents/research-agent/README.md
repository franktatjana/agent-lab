# Research Agent: Brief

## The Human Analogy

Think of the Research Agent as a junior research analyst on your team. Like a human researcher, it:

- **Gathers sources**:Searches broadly, evaluates credibility, filters noise
- **Takes notes**:Extracts key claims, tracks where information came from
- **Synthesizes**:Combines findings into coherent summaries
- **Flags uncertainty**:Admits when sources conflict or information is missing
- **Cites everything**:Never makes claims without backing

Unlike a human researcher, it:

- Works in minutes, not hours
- Never gets tired or loses focus
- Doesn't have opinions or biases about findings
- Won't make recommendations:just reports what it found

The agent is your research assistant, not your advisor. It gathers and organizes; you analyze and decide.

## Value Proposition

**For individuals:** Get up to speed on any topic in minutes. Walk into meetings prepared. Make informed decisions faster.

**For teams:** Consistent research quality across the organization. Standardized citations. Shareable, structured outputs.

**For workflows:** Research becomes a composable step in larger processes. Feed findings into analysis agents, writing agents, or decision support systems.

## How to Use

### Quick orientation (2 minutes)

```yaml
topic: "quantum computing applications in finance"
scope: "broad"
personality: "executive"
max_sources: 5
```

Returns bullet-point overview suitable for quick briefing.

### Deep dive (5-10 minutes)

```yaml
topic: "quantum computing applications in finance"
scope: "exhaustive"
personality: "detailed"
output_format: "markdown"
max_sources: 15
export_assets:
  - report
  - bibliography
```

Returns comprehensive report with methodology notes and exportable citations.

### Verify a claim

```yaml
skill: "fact-check"
claim: "Quantum computers can break RSA encryption"
```

Returns verdict with supporting/contradicting evidence.

### Compare perspectives

```yaml
skill: "compare-sources"
sources:
  - "https://source1.com/article"
  - "https://source2.com/article"
topic: "quantum computing timeline predictions"
```

Returns side-by-side analysis of agreements and conflicts.

## Multi-Agent Combinations

The Research Agent is designed to work with other agents in a pipeline:

### Research → Analysis

```text
Research Agent → Analysis Agent
"Gather information"  "Interpret findings"
```

Research Agent gathers facts; Analysis Agent identifies patterns, implications, and insights.

### Research → Writing

```text
Research Agent → Writing Agent
"Find sources"       "Draft content"
```

Research Agent provides cited findings; Writing Agent transforms into articles, reports, or documentation.

### Research → Decision Support

```text
Research Agent → Decision Agent
"Background info"    "Recommend action"
```

Research Agent provides context; Decision Agent weighs options and suggests actions.

### Orchestrated Research Pipeline

```text
Coordinator Agent
    ├── Research Agent (topic A)
    ├── Research Agent (topic B)
    └── Research Agent (topic C)
         ↓
    Synthesis Agent (combine findings)
         ↓
    Report Agent (format output)
```

Multiple Research Agents work in parallel; results feed into synthesis and reporting.

## Problem

Manual research is time-consuming. Finding credible sources, cross-referencing claims, and synthesizing findings requires sustained attention. An agent can handle the retrieval and synthesis, freeing humans for analysis and decision-making.

## Goals

- Gather relevant information from multiple sources quickly
- Cite every claim:no hallucinated facts
- Surface gaps and conflicts rather than hiding them
- Produce structured output ready for downstream use

## Non-Goals

- Making recommendations or decisions
- Deep analysis or interpretation
- Accessing paid or authenticated sources without approval

## Use Cases

- Quick research on unfamiliar topics before meetings
- Competitive landscape scanning
- Technical documentation gathering
- Background research for writing projects

## Ideas

- Add source credibility scoring
- Support for academic paper search (arXiv, Google Scholar)
- Configurable output formats (markdown, JSON, slides outline)
- Research session continuity:pick up where left off

## Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Current):** Basic web search and synthesis with citations

**Phase 2:** Source filtering by recency, domain, credibility signals

**Phase 3:** Multi-session memory, research threads

## Open Questions

- How to handle conflicting information from equally credible sources?
- What's the right balance between breadth and depth?
- Should the agent suggest follow-up research directions?

## Success Criteria

- User trusts the output enough to use it without re-verifying every source
- Time to first useful answer under 2 minutes for focused research
- Zero hallucinated sources in production use

## Glossary

- **Primary source**:Original material, firsthand accounts, raw data
- **Secondary source**:Analysis or interpretation of primary sources
- **Credibility signal**:Indicators of source trustworthiness (author expertise, publication reputation, citations)
- **Synthesis**:Combining information from multiple sources into coherent findings
- **Citation**:Reference to the source of a claim, enabling verification
- **Confidence level**:Degree of certainty based on source quality and agreement

## Processes

**Source evaluation (CRAAP test):**

- Currency:When was it published/updated?
- Relevance:Does it address the topic?
- Authority:Who created it? What are their credentials?
- Accuracy:Is it supported by evidence? Can claims be verified?
- Purpose:Why does this source exist? Bias indicators?

**Research workflow:**

1. Define scope and key questions
2. Generate search queries covering different angles
3. Gather candidate sources
4. Filter by credibility and relevance
5. Extract key claims with citations
6. Identify patterns, conflicts, gaps
7. Synthesize into structured output

## Frameworks

**Information quality hierarchy:**

- Peer-reviewed research > Official documentation > Expert analysis > News reporting > User-generated content

**Confidence assessment:**

- High:Multiple credible sources agree, recent, well-documented
- Medium:Limited sources, some uncertainty, older information
- Low:Single source, conflicting information, unverifiable claims
