# Research Synthesis Framework

How to integrate multiple sources into coherent findings.

## When to Load

- Moving from source collection to analysis
- Reconciling conflicting information
- Building narrative from disparate findings

## Synthesis vs. Summary

| Summary | Synthesis |
|---------|-----------|
| Reports what sources say | Integrates into new understanding |
| Source-by-source | Theme-by-theme |
| "Source A says X" | "The evidence suggests X" |
| Preserves original structure | Creates new structure |
| Lists | Analyzes |

## Synthesis Process

### Step 1: Extract Key Claims

For each source, identify:
- Main claims or findings
- Supporting evidence
- Methodology (if applicable)
- Limitations acknowledged
- Confidence level

### Step 2: Map the Landscape

Organize claims by:
- **Agreement**: What do multiple sources confirm?
- **Contradiction**: Where do sources disagree?
- **Gaps**: What questions remain unanswered?
- **Uncertainty**: Where is evidence weak?

### Step 3: Reconcile Contradictions

When sources disagree:

1. **Check source quality**: Is one source more authoritative?
2. **Check recency**: Has understanding evolved?
3. **Check scope**: Are they answering different questions?
4. **Check methodology**: Different methods, different findings?
5. **Check definitions**: Are they using terms differently?

If contradiction persists:
- Report both views with reasoning
- State which view you find more credible and why
- Flag as an open question

### Step 4: Identify Patterns

Look for:
- **Convergence**: Multiple independent sources reaching same conclusion
- **Trends**: Direction of change over time
- **Relationships**: How factors interact
- **Outliers**: Unusual findings that may signal emerging change
- **Consensus vs. contested**: Where is there agreement?

### Step 5: Build Narrative

Organize findings by:
- **Importance**: Lead with what matters most
- **Logic**: Build from foundation to conclusions
- **Audience need**: What do they need to know first?

## Synthesis Structures

### Thematic Synthesis

Organize by themes that emerge from the data.

```
Theme 1: [Finding]
  - Evidence from Source A
  - Evidence from Source B
  - Synthesis: What this means

Theme 2: [Finding]
  ...
```

Best for: Exploratory research, complex topics

### Comparative Synthesis

Organize by comparing elements.

```
Factor 1: Option A vs. Option B vs. Option C
Factor 2: Option A vs. Option B vs. Option C
...
Recommendation: Based on factors, X is preferred
```

Best for: Decision support, evaluations

### Chronological Synthesis

Organize by how understanding evolved.

```
Historical context: How we got here
Current state: What we know now
Emerging trends: Where it's going
```

Best for: Evolving topics, trend analysis

### Problem-Solution Synthesis

Organize around issues and responses.

```
Problem 1: [Issue]
  - Contributing factors
  - Attempted solutions
  - What works / What doesn't

Problem 2: [Issue]
  ...
```

Best for: Applied research, recommendations

## Quality Markers

### Good Synthesis

- Claims cite multiple supporting sources
- Contradictions are acknowledged and addressed
- Confidence levels vary with evidence strength
- Original insight emerges from combination
- Reader gains understanding, not just information

### Poor Synthesis

- Claims cite single sources each
- Contradictions are ignored or hidden
- Everything stated with equal confidence
- Just rearranged summaries
- Reader has more data but no more understanding

## Synthesis Phrases

### Showing Agreement
- "Multiple sources confirm that..."
- "There is consensus that..."
- "The evidence consistently shows..."

### Showing Contradiction
- "Sources disagree on..."
- "While [Source A] argues X, [Source B] finds Y..."
- "The evidence is mixed, with..."

### Showing Uncertainty
- "Limited evidence suggests..."
- "Preliminary findings indicate..."
- "More research is needed to confirm..."

### Showing Confidence
- "Strong evidence demonstrates..."
- "It is well-established that..."
- "Research consistently finds..."

## Common Synthesis Errors

| Error | Example | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| False consensus | "Everyone agrees" when some don't | Note dissenting views |
| False balance | Equal weight to unequal evidence | Weight by evidence quality |
| Missing synthesis | "A says X. B says Y." (period) | Add "This suggests..." |
| Overgeneralization | One study → universal claim | Note scope limitations |
| Cherry-picking | Only cite supporting evidence | Seek and address contrary evidence |
| Recency bias | Recent = better | Include foundational work |
