# Research Quality Framework

Standards for evaluating and producing quality research outputs.

## When to Load

- Planning research scope and methodology
- Evaluating draft research outputs
- Quality-checking before delivery

## Research Quality Dimensions

### 1. Scope Clarity

Is the research question well-defined?

- [ ] Research question is specific and answerable
- [ ] Scope boundaries are explicit (what's in, what's out)
- [ ] Time frame is specified
- [ ] Geographic/demographic scope is defined
- [ ] Depth level is agreed (surface, moderate, deep)

**Anti-patterns:**
- "Research X" without specifying what about X
- Scope that expands during research without acknowledgment
- Questions that can't be answered with available sources

### 2. Source Coverage

Has the relevant landscape been adequately explored?

- [ ] Multiple source types consulted (not just web search)
- [ ] Key authorities in the field identified
- [ ] Conflicting viewpoints represented
- [ ] Primary sources used where available
- [ ] Coverage appropriate to depth level

**Anti-patterns:**
- First-page-of-Google-only research
- Echo chamber (all sources say the same thing)
- Missing obvious authoritative sources
- Over-reliance on single source type

### 3. Analytical Rigor

Is the analysis sound?

- [ ] Claims are supported by evidence
- [ ] Reasoning is explicit and traceable
- [ ] Assumptions are stated
- [ ] Limitations are acknowledged
- [ ] Uncertainty is quantified where possible
- [ ] Conclusions follow from evidence

**Anti-patterns:**
- Assertions without evidence
- Cherry-picking supporting data
- Ignoring contradictory evidence
- Overstating certainty
- Logical leaps

### 4. Synthesis Quality

Is the output more than a collection of sources?

- [ ] Information is integrated, not just listed
- [ ] Patterns and themes are identified
- [ ] Contradictions are addressed
- [ ] Original insight is provided
- [ ] So-what is clear

**Anti-patterns:**
- Book report style (Source A says X, Source B says Y)
- Copy-paste compilation
- Missing synthesis across sources
- Conclusions disconnected from evidence

### 5. Actionability

Can the recipient use this?

- [ ] Recommendations are specific and implementable
- [ ] Next steps are clear
- [ ] Trade-offs are explained
- [ ] Gaps requiring further research are identified
- [ ] Format matches recipient's needs

**Anti-patterns:**
- Academic tone when practical advice needed
- Recommendations without rationale
- One-size-fits-all answers
- Missing "so what do I do with this?"

### 6. Intellectual Honesty

Is the research trustworthy?

- [ ] Uncertainty is explicit, not hidden
- [ ] Sources are attributed
- [ ] Limitations are stated
- [ ] Conflicting evidence is acknowledged
- [ ] Own biases are considered
- [ ] What the research cannot answer is stated

**Anti-patterns:**
- False confidence
- Hidden assumptions
- Ignoring inconvenient findings
- Presenting opinion as fact
- Overclaiming from limited evidence

## Quality Levels

### Deep Research

Maximum rigor, comprehensive coverage.

- 10+ sources across multiple types
- Primary sources where available
- Expert/authoritative sources prioritized
- Systematic search strategy documented
- Conflicting views reconciled or explained
- Methodology documented

### Moderate Research

Solid coverage, practical depth.

- 5-10 sources
- Mix of primary and secondary sources
- Key authorities represented
- Major perspectives covered
- Limitations noted

### Surface Research

Quick orientation, directional accuracy.

- 3-5 sources
- Focus on authoritative overviews
- Main facts and figures
- Sufficient for initial decisions
- Flags gaps for deeper investigation

## Output Quality Checklist

Before delivering research, verify:

### Structure
- [ ] Executive summary captures key findings
- [ ] Organization is logical and scannable
- [ ] Depth matches agreed scope
- [ ] Format matches requested output

### Content
- [ ] Answers the actual question asked
- [ ] Claims are supported
- [ ] Sources are cited
- [ ] Confidence levels are indicated
- [ ] Limitations are stated

### Usability
- [ ] Actionable for the recipient
- [ ] Appropriate level of detail
- [ ] Clear next steps or recommendations
- [ ] Gaps identified for follow-up

## Common Failure Modes

| Failure | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Scope creep | Research keeps expanding | Reset to original question |
| Surface masquerading as depth | Lots of sources, no synthesis | Analyze, don't just compile |
| False precision | Numbers without context | Add confidence intervals, caveats |
| Recency bias | Only recent sources | Include foundational/historical sources |
| Authority worship | Cited expert, didn't verify | Cross-check expert claims |
| Confirmation bias | All sources agree | Actively seek contradicting views |
