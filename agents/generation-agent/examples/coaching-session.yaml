  They describe the team as "always on their phones but never available"
  and want to improve communication.

skill: coach-sender
personality: coach

# Input
input:
  sender_generation: gen-x
  target_generations:
    - gen-z
  challenges: "Team is always on their phones but never answers when I call. They respond to Slack eventually but it feels like pulling teeth to get face time."
  strengths: "Direct communicator, gets to the point, team respects my expertise"
  learning_style: principles
  output_format: yaml

# Expected Output
output:
  assessment:
    current_patterns:
      - "Expects phone calls to be answered like they were in earlier career"
      - "Interprets async communication as avoidance or disengagement"
      - "Values face time as primary relationship-building tool"
    strengths_to_leverage:
      - "Directness is valued across generations when applied appropriately"
      - "Technical expertise gives credibility; communication is the gap"
      - "Genuine care for team is evident, just expressed differently"
    growth_areas:
      - "Channel flexibility: meeting team where they are"
      - "Async appreciation: understanding text as legitimate work communication"
      - "Reframing: 'on phone' doesn't mean 'available for calls'"

  skill_development:
    - skill: "Channel flexibility"
      why_it_matters: "Your team's preferred channel is where they're most responsive and engaged"
      current_level: "Strong preference for synchronous; async feels like compromise"
      target_level: "Natural choice of channel based on message type and recipient preference"

    - skill: "Async-first mindset"
      why_it_matters: "Gen Z often does their best thinking with time to compose responses"
      current_level: "Async feels slow and disconnected"
      target_level: "Recognizes async as efficient and respectful of focus time"

  exercises:
    - exercise: "The 24-Hour Slack Experiment"
      purpose: "Experience async communication from a learning perspective"
      how_to_do_it: |
        For one week, try this sequence for non-urgent matters:
        1. Default to Slack instead of calling
        2. Send clear, complete messages (context + question + timeline)
        3. Allow 24 hours for response before following up
        4. Notice: How does the quality of responses compare to phone?
      success_looks_like: "You discover that async responses are often more thoughtful and complete"

    - exercise: "The 'Phone or Slack?' Question"
      purpose: "Build habit of meeting team members where they are"
      how_to_do_it: |
        For important but non-urgent discussions, ask:
        "I want to discuss X. Would you prefer a quick call or Slack thread?"
        Track what they choose and how the conversation goes.
      success_looks_like: "You have data on individual preferences and honor them"

    - exercise: "Observe Phone Usage"
      purpose: "Reframe 'always on phones' into accurate observation"
      how_to_do_it: |
        Next time you notice team on phones, observe without judgment:
        - Are they responding to work Slack?
        - Are they checking docs or email?
        - Are they on break (which is legitimate)?
        Notice: How much of 'phone time' is actually work communication?
      success_looks_like: "You distinguish between 'available on phone' and 'available for phone calls'"

  mental_models:
    - model: "The Phone Is Not a Phone"
      description: "For Gen Z, a smartphone is primarily a texting and app device. Voice calls are one rare use among many. When they're 'on their phone,' they're often working, just not in the way you expect."
      when_to_apply: "When frustration builds about team being 'on phones but not answering'"

    - model: "Async Is Respect"
      description: "Async communication respects the recipient's focus time and gives them space to think. It's not avoidance; it's courtesy."
      when_to_apply: "When tempted to interpret slow response as disengagement"

    - model: "Channel Match = Engagement"
      description: "People engage most fully on their preferred channel. Using their channel isn't compromising; it's optimizing for outcome."
      when_to_apply: "When choosing how to communicate important information"

  progress_indicators:
    - indicator: "Channel choice"
      novice: "Default to phone; async feels like compromise"
      developing: "Chooses async for some messages; still prefers calls"
      proficient: "Natural channel selection based on message type and recipient"

    - indicator: "Response interpretation"
      novice: "Slow async response = avoidance or disengagement"
      developing: "Accepts async but still prefers immediate"
      proficient: "Values thoughtful async responses as often superior"

    - indicator: "Team relationship"
      novice: "Friction over communication; team feels micromanaged"
      developing: "Less friction; team more responsive"
      proficient: "Team proactively communicates; mutual respect evident"

  reflection_questions:
    - "What if 'always on their phone' actually meant 'always available, just differently'?"
    - "When you were their age, what new communication technology did older colleagues struggle with?"
    - "What's the actual outcome you want: face time, or effective communication?"
    - "How might they perceive unexpected phone calls?"
    - "What would it look like to truly meet them where they are?"

  next_session_focus: "Review experiments: What did you try? What did you notice? What surprised you?"

# Notes for testing
notes:
  - Coach personality asks questions before providing answers
  - Reframes negative interpretation ("always on phones") into curiosity
  - Exercises are concrete and observable
  - Progress indicators help track development over time
  - Reflection questions promote self-discovery
