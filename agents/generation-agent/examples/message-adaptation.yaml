  ## Analysis

  **Source style:** Casual, abbreviation-heavy, open-ended scheduling
  **Target preferences:** Formal greeting, complete sentences, specific proposals

  ### Potential Friction Points
  - "Hey!" is too casual for executive communication
  - "Quick q" and "LMK" require decoding
  - "grab 15 min" is informal for professional meeting request
  - Open-ended availability puts scheduling burden on executive

  ### Context Factors
  - Junior to senior relationship requires more formal approach
  - Executive time is valuable; specific proposals show respect
  - Q4 projections is business-critical topic requiring professional framing

  ## Adapted Message

  Dear [Name],

  I hope this message finds you well. I would like to request a brief meeting to discuss the Q4 projections. I have some questions about [specific topic] that I believe would benefit from your guidance.

  Would you have 15 minutes available on Thursday or Friday afternoon? I'm happy to work around your schedule.

  Thank you for your time.

  Best regards,
  [Your name]

  ## What Changed

  | Original Element | Adapted Element | Why |
  |-----------------|-----------------|-----|
  | "Hey!" | "Dear [Name]," | Professional greeting for senior executive |
  | "Quick q" | "I would like to request a brief meeting" | Formal request language |
  | "chat about" | "discuss" | Professional vocabulary |
  | "LMK what works" | Specific days + flexibility | Shows initiative while respecting their time |
  | (no closing) | "Thank you... Best regards" | Professional sign-off expected at this level |

  ## Alternatives

  1. **Email with calendar link**: Include Calendly or calendar link for easy scheduling
     - *Tradeoff:* Some executives prefer to handle scheduling through assistants

  2. **Go through assistant**: If executive has EA, route through them
     - *Tradeoff:* May be more appropriate for very senior executives

  ## Recommendations

  - Consider whether this request should go through the executive's assistant
  - Be prepared with specific agenda items when meeting is scheduled
  - Send calendar invite with clear purpose after time is confirmed

# Notes for testing
notes:
  - Formality increase is appropriate for junior→senior dynamic
  - Specific time proposals show respect without being presumptuous
  - Maintains core request while adjusting delivery
