# Leadership Archetypes

Real and fictional leadership examples organized by style. Use these as reference points to help leaders identify their natural approach, see alternatives, and find role models that resonate.

## The Believer

**Core**: Relentless optimism backed by genuine care. Believes in people before they believe in themselves. Uses humor and curiosity to disarm, then holds people accountable through the relationship.

**Examples**:
- Ted Lasso (TV): Arrives in a hostile environment with zero domain expertise. Wins through curiosity, vulnerability, and belief in people. "I believe in believe." Key lesson: competence isn't the only currency of leadership.
- Herb Brooks (Miracle, 1980 US hockey): Built a team from individual talent by making the mission bigger than the players. Pushed relentlessly but created fierce loyalty.

**When it works**: Teams that have lost confidence. Turnaround situations. Cultures of blame that need to shift to growth.

**Watch out for**: Can tip into toxic positivity if the leader avoids hard truths. Belief without accountability is just wishful thinking.

## The Mission Commander

**Core**: Clear mission, decentralized execution. Sets the intent, trusts the team to figure out the how. Holds the line on standards while giving maximum autonomy.

**Examples**:
- Stanley McChrystal (Team of Teams): Transformed US special operations from hierarchical command to networked teams. Shared consciousness + empowered execution. Key insight: "The temptation to lead as a chess master, controlling each move, must give way to leading as a gardener."
- Jocko Willink (Extreme Ownership): Every failure is the leader's responsibility. No excuses, no blame. "There are no bad teams, only bad leaders." Brutal accountability starting with yourself.
- Jim Mattis: "Be polite, be professional, but have a plan." Commander's Intent doctrine: tell people the what and why, never the how.

**When it works**: High-competence teams. Fast-moving environments. When decisions must happen at the edge, not the center.

**Watch out for**: Requires trust that takes time to build. New or low-skill teams need more structure first (Situational Leadership R1/R2).

## The Servant Leader

**Core**: The leader's job is to serve the people they lead. Remove obstacles, develop capability, create conditions for success. Power flows from service, not authority.

**Examples**:
- Satya Nadella (Microsoft): Transformed Microsoft's culture from "know-it-all" to "learn-it-all." Replaced internal competition with curiosity and empathy. Key move: started leadership meetings by asking "what did you learn?"
- Captain Picard (Star Trek: TNG): Leads through questions, not commands. "Make it so" delegates fully. Listens before deciding. Admits mistakes publicly. Treats every crew member's perspective as valuable.
- Cheryl Bachelder (Popeyes): Turned around a failing restaurant chain by serving franchisees instead of dictating to them. "Dare to serve."

**When it works**: Knowledge work. Creative teams. Situations where engagement and ownership matter more than compliance.

**Watch out for**: Can be mistaken for passivity. Servant leadership still requires tough decisions and clear standards.

## The Accountability Leader

**Core**: High standards, no exceptions, starting with themselves. Builds cultures where people hold each other accountable because the leader modeled it first. Direct, fair, consistent.

**Examples**:
- Bill Walsh (The Score Takes Care of Itself): Didn't focus on winning, focused on "the Standard of Performance," a detailed behavioral code for how professionals act. When the standard was met, winning followed.
- Admiral McRaven (Make Your Bed): Small disciplines compound. If you can't do the little things right, you can't do the big things. Leadership starts with personal standards.
- Coach K, Mike Krzyzewski (Duke basketball): Built a program on "next play" mentality. Mistakes are fine, dwelling on them isn't. Accountability is always forward-looking.

**When it works**: Teams that lack discipline or consistency. Rebuilding after failure. Organizations where accountability has been absent.

**Watch out for**: Without care and context, high standards feel like punishment. Accountability without empathy creates compliance, not commitment.

## The Transformational Leader

**Core**: Inspires change by connecting daily work to a larger purpose. Challenges the status quo. Makes people want to be better, not just do better.

**Examples**:
- Ed Catmull (Pixar, Creativity Inc.): Built a culture where candor was mandatory and hierarchy didn't determine whose idea won. "If you give a good idea to a mediocre team, they'll screw it up. If you give a mediocre idea to a brilliant team, they'll fix it."
- Ernest Shackleton (Endurance expedition): Ship crushed by ice, crew stranded in Antarctica. Kept every person alive through two years of survival. Led through presence, optimism, and never asking anyone to do what he wouldn't do himself.
- Jacinda Ardern (New Zealand PM): Led through crisis with empathy and decisiveness simultaneously. Showed that compassion and strength are not opposites.

**When it works**: Organizational change. Building new teams or cultures. When the mission requires people to reach beyond their current capability.

**Watch out for**: Inspiration without execution is just speeches. Transformational leaders need operational discipline to back up the vision.

## Using Archetypes in Coaching

Archetypes are mirrors, not prescriptions. Use them to:

1. **Identify defaults**: "Which of these sounds most like you on autopilot?"
2. **Expand range**: "Your team needs a Mission Commander right now, but you're leading like a Believer. What would McChrystal do here?"
3. **Find role models**: "Who resonates with you? Study how they handle situations like yours."
4. **Spot gaps**: "You're strong on accountability but low on servant leadership. What would Picard do differently?"

No leader is one archetype. The goal is range: knowing when to believe, when to command, when to serve, and when to hold the line.
