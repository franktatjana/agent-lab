# Leadership Frameworks

## GROW Model (Sir John Whitmore)

The foundational coaching conversation framework. Structures any development conversation into four phases.

- **Goal**: What do you want to achieve? Make it specific and meaningful.
- **Reality**: What's actually happening now? Honest assessment without judgment.
- **Options**: What could you do? Explore the full range before choosing.
- **Will**: What will you do? Specific commitment with accountability.

The power of GROW is its simplicity: it prevents the coach from jumping to solutions (Options) before the coachee understands their situation (Reality).

## Situational Leadership (Hersey & Blanchard)

No single leadership style works for every situation. The right approach depends on the person's readiness level for a specific task.

| Readiness | Competence | Commitment | Leader Style |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| R1 | Low | High | Directing: clear instructions, close guidance |
| R2 | Some | Low | Coaching: explain why, encourage, support + direct |
| R3 | High | Variable | Supporting: listen, share decisions, build confidence |
| R4 | High | High | Delegating: trust, hand off, get out of the way |

Common mistake: using one style for everyone. A leader who only delegates frustrates beginners. A leader who only directs suffocates experts.

## Servant Leadership (Robert Greenleaf)

The leader's primary role is to serve the people they lead. Serving first, leading second.

Core practices:
- **Listen first**: understand before acting
- **Empathy**: accept people as they are
- **Awareness**: of self, team, and system
- **Persuasion over authority**: convince, don't coerce
- **Stewardship**: hold the role in trust for others
- **Commitment to growth**: develop people, not just performance

Servant leadership isn't weakness. It's choosing influence over authority because influence scales and authority doesn't.

## Psychological Safety (Amy Edmondson)

The belief that you won't be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes. Required for learning, innovation, and honest accountability.

Four stages of psychological safety:
1. **Inclusion safety**: I belong here
2. **Learner safety**: I can ask questions and make mistakes
3. **Contributor safety**: I can offer ideas and challenge the status quo
4. **Challenger safety**: I can disagree with authority without retaliation

The leader sets the tone. Psychological safety is not about being nice, it's about making it safe to be honest.

## Radical Candor (Kim Scott)

Two dimensions define effective leadership communication:

- **Care Personally**: Show genuine concern for the person
- **Challenge Directly**: Be willing to tell them the truth

| | Low Challenge | High Challenge |
|---|---|---|
| **High Care** | Ruinous Empathy | Radical Candor |
| **Low Care** | Manipulative Insincerity | Obnoxious Aggression |

Most leaders default to Ruinous Empathy: they care about people but avoid challenging them. The result is stagnation disguised as kindness.
