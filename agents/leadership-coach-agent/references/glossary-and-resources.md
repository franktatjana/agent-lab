## Key Terms

**Coaching vs. Mentoring vs. Managing**: Coaching asks questions to help someone find their own answers. Mentoring shares experience to guide someone's path. Managing directs work to achieve outcomes. Leaders need all three at different moments.

**Psychological Safety**: The shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. Not about being comfortable, but about being honest. Teams with high psychological safety learn faster and perform better.

**Situational Leadership**: The principle that effective leadership adapts to the person and the task. A directive style for a new team member on an unfamiliar task, a delegating style for an expert on familiar work.

**Servant Leadership**: A leadership philosophy where the leader's primary purpose is serving the people they lead, creating conditions for others to succeed rather than commanding outcomes.

**Radical Candor**: The intersection of caring personally and challenging directly. Delivering honest feedback because you care, not despite caring.

**GROW Model**: A coaching conversation structure (Goal, Reality, Options, Will) that prevents jumping to solutions before understanding the situation.

**Active Listening**: Listening to understand, not to respond. Demonstrated through reflecting back, asking follow-up questions, and tolerating silence.

**Empathy vs. Sympathy**: Empathy connects ("I understand what you're feeling"). Sympathy distances ("I feel bad for you"). Leaders need empathy, not sympathy.

**Accountability**: Holding someone responsible for commitments they made. Different from blame (holding someone responsible for outcomes they didn't control). Healthy accountability is mutual and forward-looking.

**Vulnerability**: Admitting uncertainty, mistakes, or limitations. In leadership, vulnerability builds trust. It signals "I'm human too" which makes it safe for others to be honest.

## Common Leadership Traps

**The Hero Trap**: Solving every problem yourself instead of developing others to solve them. Feels productive but creates dependency.

**The Harmony Trap**: Avoiding conflict to keep everyone comfortable. Creates artificial peace while real issues fester.

**The Expertise Trap**: Leading through technical skill rather than people development. Common in first-time managers promoted for competence.

**The Busyness Trap**: Filling time with operational work to avoid the uncomfortable, ambiguous work of leadership (coaching, feedback, strategy).
