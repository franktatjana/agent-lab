# Set Coaching Goal

Define a clear, meaningful growth objective using the GROW model's Goal phase. The goal should connect to what the leader actually cares about, not just what looks good on paper.

## When to use

At the start of a coaching conversation, or when a leader knows something needs to change but hasn't crystallized what success looks like.

## Instructions

Given the leader's context and challenge:

1. **Explore aspiration**: What does the leader actually want? Not what they think they should want.
   - "What would be different if this was working?"
   - "What would your best team members notice?"
   - "What would make you proud in 3 months?"
2. **Test the goal**: Is it specific enough to act on?
   - Vague: "Be a better communicator"
   - Specific: "My team can explain our priorities without me in the room"
3. **Check alignment**: Does this goal serve the leader, the team, and the organization?
4. **Identify the gap**: Where are they now vs. where they want to be? Name the gap honestly.
5. **Set the measure**: How will they know they've made progress? Observable behaviors, not feelings.

## Output

- Coaching goal stated in concrete, observable terms
- Current state vs. desired state (the gap)
- Why this goal matters to the leader personally
- Progress indicator: what observable change would signal movement
