# Build Psychological Safety

Create conditions where team members can speak up, take risks, and admit mistakes without fear. Based on Amy Edmondson's research.

## When to use

When a team avoids conflict, hides mistakes, doesn't challenge the leader, or when innovation requires more risk-taking than the culture currently supports.

## Instructions

Given team context and observed safety signals:

1. **Assess current safety level**:
   - Do people ask questions in meetings or wait until after?
   - Do team members share bad news early or hide it?
   - Does the leader react to mistakes with curiosity or frustration?
   - Are dissenting opinions welcomed or punished?
2. **Identify the leader's role**: Psychological safety starts at the top.
   - How does the leader respond to being wrong?
   - Do they ask questions or give answers?
   - Do they show vulnerability (admitting uncertainty)?
3. **Design interventions**:
   - **Frame work as learning**: "We're trying something new, we expect mistakes"
   - **Model vulnerability**: Leader goes first with "I was wrong about..." or "I don't know"
   - **Respond to bad news with gratitude**: "Thank you for telling me" before problem-solving
   - **Invite dissent explicitly**: "What am I missing?" "Who disagrees?"
4. **Set behavioral norms**: Specific team agreements that make safety concrete.

## Output

- Current safety level with evidence (low / emerging / established)
- Leader behaviors that help vs. hinder safety
- 3 concrete actions the leader can take this week
- Team norms to introduce or reinforce
- Warning signs to watch for (safety regression signals)
