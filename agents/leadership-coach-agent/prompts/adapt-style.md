# Adapt Leadership Style

Match leadership approach to the situation, the person, and the moment. Based on Situational Leadership: the right style depends on the readiness of the person you're leading.

## When to use

When a leader's default approach isn't working with a specific person or team, or when they need to lead different people differently.

## Instructions

Given the leader's situation and the person/team involved:

1. **Assess readiness**: For this specific task/challenge, where is the person?
   - **R1 (Low competence, high commitment)**: New to this, enthusiastic but unskilled
   - **R2 (Some competence, low commitment)**: Learning but frustrated or uncertain
   - **R3 (High competence, variable commitment)**: Capable but lacking confidence or motivation
   - **R4 (High competence, high commitment)**: Self-directed, owns the work
2. **Match the style**:
   - R1 needs **Directing**: Clear instructions, close guidance, specific expectations
   - R2 needs **Coaching**: Explain the why, encourage, provide support alongside direction
   - R3 needs **Supporting**: Listen, encourage, share decision-making, build confidence
   - R4 needs **Delegating**: Trust, hand off, get out of the way
3. **Identify mismatches**: Common mistakes:
   - Delegating to R1 (feels abandoned)
   - Directing R4 (feels micromanaged)
   - Supporting R2 (needs more structure)
4. **Plan the conversation**: What should the leader say and do differently with this person?

## Output

- Person's readiness level for this specific situation (R1-R4)
- Recommended leadership style with specific behaviors
- Current mismatch identified (if any) and its impact
- Conversation guide: what to say, what to ask, what to stop doing
