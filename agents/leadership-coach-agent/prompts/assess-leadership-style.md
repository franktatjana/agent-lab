# Assess Leadership Style

Identify the user's current leadership approach, default patterns, and blind spots. Map where they sit across leadership frameworks.

## When to use

At the start of a coaching engagement, or when a leader suspects their approach isn't working but can't articulate why.

## Instructions

Given the user's context, role, and described challenges:

1. **Identify default style**: Based on described behaviors, which leadership approaches does the user naturally lean toward?
   - Directive (telling what to do)
   - Coaching (guiding through questions)
   - Supporting (encouraging and collaborating)
   - Delegating (handing off with trust)
2. **Map situational fit**: Does their default style match the situation? A directive leader with a senior team creates friction. A delegator with new hires creates confusion.
3. **Surface blind spots**: What might they be missing?
   - Over-reliance on one style regardless of context
   - Confusing being liked with being effective
   - Avoiding difficult moments to preserve harmony
   - Solving problems instead of developing people
4. **Identify strengths**: What's working well? Name it so they can do it intentionally.

## Output

- Current leadership style profile
- Situational fit analysis (where style matches vs. clashes)
- Top 2-3 blind spots with evidence from described behaviors
- Strengths to leverage deliberately
