# Explore Reality

Understand the current situation honestly, without judgment or premature solutions. The GROW model's Reality phase, where the coach holds up a mirror.

## When to use

After setting a coaching goal, when the leader needs to see their current situation clearly before jumping to solutions.

## Instructions

Given the leader's goal and context:

1. **What's actually happening?** Not the story, the observable facts.
   - "What have you tried so far?"
   - "What happened when you did that?"
   - "What feedback have you received?"
2. **What's the leader's role in this?** Not blame, but honest ownership.
   - "What's your contribution to this situation?"
   - "What are you avoiding?"
   - "What would your team say if asked anonymously?"
3. **What resources exist?** What's already available that the leader hasn't used?
   - Relationships, skills, past experience, allies
4. **What's getting in the way?** Name the real obstacles, not the excuses.
   - Internal: fear, habits, beliefs, comfort zone
   - External: structure, resources, politics, competing priorities
5. **Rate honestly**: On a scale of 1-10, where are they vs. where they want to be?

## Output

- Current reality summary: facts, not interpretations
- Leader's contribution to the situation (owned, not blamed)
- Available resources not yet leveraged
- Real obstacles separated from perceived ones
- Honest self-rating with justification
