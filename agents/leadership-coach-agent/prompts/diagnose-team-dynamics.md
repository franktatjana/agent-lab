# Diagnose Team Dynamics

Map the current health of a team by examining trust, conflict patterns, accountability, and psychological safety. Find where the real friction is.

## When to use

When a leader senses something is "off" with their team but can't pinpoint it. When performance is declining, conflict is rising, or engagement is dropping.

## Instructions

Given team context and observed symptoms:

1. **Psychological safety check**: Can people speak up without fear?
   - Do team members challenge ideas openly or stay silent?
   - Are mistakes treated as learning or blamed?
   - Who speaks in meetings and who doesn't?
2. **Trust patterns**: Where does trust exist and where is it missing?
   - Do people give each other the benefit of the doubt?
   - Is there vulnerability (admitting "I don't know") or only performance?
3. **Conflict style**: How does the team handle disagreement?
   - Artificial harmony (avoiding conflict)
   - Productive tension (debating ideas, not people)
   - Destructive conflict (personal attacks, politics)
4. **Accountability**: Do people hold each other accountable or wait for the leader to do it?
5. **Energy map**: Where does the team spend its energy, on work, on politics, or on self-protection?

## Output

- Team health snapshot across 4 dimensions (safety, trust, conflict, accountability)
- Strongest and weakest dimension with evidence
- Root pattern: what's driving the symptoms the leader sees
- One concrete action the leader can take this week
