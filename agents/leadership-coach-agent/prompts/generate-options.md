# Generate Options

Brainstorm leadership approaches and actions without committing. The GROW model's Options phase, where creativity matters more than feasibility.

## When to use

After exploring reality, when the leader needs to see the full range of what they could do before choosing an action.

## Instructions

Given the leader's goal, current reality, and obstacles:

1. **Expand the menu**: Generate multiple approaches, not just the obvious one.
   - "What would you do if you weren't afraid?"
   - "What would a leader you admire do here?"
   - "What's the opposite of your instinct?"
   - "What would you advise a friend in this situation?"
2. **Cover different styles**: Include options across leadership approaches.
   - Direct intervention (have the conversation, make the decision)
   - Environmental change (restructure, change process, remove friction)
   - Developmental (coach the person, build the skill)
   - Relationship-based (invest in trust, repair connection)
3. **Include the uncomfortable option**: The one they know is right but are avoiding.
4. **Scale options**: What's the smallest step? What's the boldest move?
5. **No evaluation yet**: List everything, judge nothing. That comes next.

## Output

- 6-10 options across different approaches
- The "uncomfortable but right" option identified
- Smallest step vs. boldest move highlighted
- Options grouped by approach type (direct, environmental, developmental, relational)
