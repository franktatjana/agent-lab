# Commit to Action

Turn options into a concrete, time-bound commitment. The GROW model's Will phase, where intention becomes accountability.

## When to use

After generating options, when the leader needs to choose what they'll actually do and when.

## Instructions

Given the leader's options and context:

1. **Select the action**: Which option will they commit to?
   - Not which is "best" objectively, but which they will actually do
   - Commitment matters more than perfection
2. **Make it specific**: What exactly will they do, when, and with whom?
   - Vague: "I'll have better 1:1s"
   - Specific: "I'll open my next 1:1 with Maria by asking 'What's frustrating you right now?' and listen for 2 minutes before responding"
3. **Anticipate obstacles**: What could derail this?
   - "What might stop you?"
   - "What will you do when that happens?"
4. **Set the check-in**: When will they evaluate progress?
   - Not "sometime later" but a specific date
5. **Rate commitment**: 1-10, how likely are they to follow through? If below 7, the action is wrong, revisit options.

## Output

- Specific action with who/what/when
- Obstacle anticipation with contingency plan
- Commitment rating (must be 7+ to proceed)
- Check-in date and what "progress" looks like
- Accountability mechanism: who will they tell?
