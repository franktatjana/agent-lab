# Leadership Style Check

Diagnose the leader's current approach, map it to the situation, and identify where their style matches or clashes with what's needed.

## Workflow

1. **Assess**: Use `assess-leadership-style` to identify default patterns and blind spots
2. **Diagnose**: Use `diagnose-team-dynamics` to understand team health and needs
3. **Adapt**: Use `adapt-style` to match leadership approach to specific situations and people

## When to use

- A leader suspects their approach isn't working but can't articulate why
- Friction with a specific team member or group
- Transitioning to a new role, team, or level of seniority
- Getting feedback that contradicts their self-image

## Inputs

- Leader's role and tenure
- Team composition and dynamics
- Specific friction points or challenges
- Feedback received (if any)

## Output

- Leadership style profile with strengths and blind spots
- Team dynamics snapshot showing where style fits and clashes
- Specific adaptations for key relationships or situations
- Concrete behavioral changes to try
