# Coaching Conversation

A structured 1:1 coaching session using the GROW model. Walks the leader through setting a goal, understanding reality, exploring options, and committing to action.

## Workflow

1. **Goal**: Use `set-coaching-goal` to define a clear, meaningful growth objective
2. **Reality**: Use `explore-reality` to understand the current situation honestly
3. **Options**: Use `generate-options` to brainstorm leadership approaches without committing
4. **Will**: Use `commit-to-action` to turn the chosen option into a specific, time-bound commitment

## When to use

- A leader is stuck on a specific challenge and needs structured thinking
- Regular coaching check-ins to work through growth areas
- Before a high-stakes leadership moment (difficult conversation, team change, strategic shift)
- When a leader keeps circling the same issue without progress

## Inputs

- The leadership challenge or growth area
- Context: role, team, organization
- What they've already tried
- Timeline or urgency

## Output

- Clear coaching goal with success measure
- Honest reality assessment with leader's contribution owned
- Menu of options across leadership styles
- Specific action commitment with accountability mechanism
