# Team Health Check

Assess the overall health of a team across trust, psychological safety, accountability, and conflict patterns. Find the root issue, not just the symptoms.

## Workflow

1. **Diagnose**: Use `diagnose-team-dynamics` to map current team health across key dimensions
2. **Safety**: Use `build-psychological-safety` to address the foundation of team trust
3. **Adapt**: Use `adapt-style` to tailor the leader's approach to the team's current needs

## When to use

- Team performance is declining and the leader can't pinpoint why
- After a team change (new members, restructuring, leadership transition)
- Conflict is rising or engagement is dropping
- The leader wants to proactively strengthen their team before problems emerge

## Inputs

- Team size, composition, and tenure
- Observed symptoms (silence in meetings, missed deadlines, turnover, etc.)
- Recent changes (people, process, priorities)
- Leader's self-assessment of their relationship with the team

## Output

- Team health snapshot across 4 dimensions
- Root pattern behind surface symptoms
- Psychological safety level with leader's contribution identified
- Prioritized action plan with this-week and this-month actions
