# Leadership Growth Plan

Create a focused development plan that connects self-awareness with specific, measurable growth actions. Combines style assessment with coaching commitment.

## Workflow

1. **Assess**: Use `assess-leadership-style` to identify current strengths and growth areas
2. **Goal**: Use `set-coaching-goal` to define what growth looks like concretely
3. **Adapt**: Use `adapt-style` to plan specific behavioral changes for key situations
4. **Commit**: Use `commit-to-action` to create accountable, time-bound actions

## When to use
