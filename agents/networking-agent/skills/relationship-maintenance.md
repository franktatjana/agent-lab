# Relationship Maintenance

Build a system for keeping relationships alive and growing your visibility.

## Prompts Used

1. **plan-followup** - Design follow-up cadence and touchpoint strategy
2. **build-visibility** - Strategies for organic network growth through visibility

## Workflow

```
[Plan Follow-Up] → tiered system + touchpoints → [Build Visibility] → organic growth strategy
```

## When to Use

- You meet people but relationships fade after the first interaction
- Your network feels dormant and you want to reactivate it
- You want a system instead of relying on memory
- You want your network to grow through attraction, not just outreach

## What You'll Get

1. Contact tiering system (monthly/quarterly/bi-annual touchpoints)
2. Touchpoint ideas tailored to your style and available time
3. Reactivation strategy for dormant relationships
4. Visibility plan: what to share, where, and how often
5. Simple tracking system recommendation

## Example Input

"I'm pretty good at meeting people but terrible at follow-up. I'll have a great conversation at a conference and then never talk to them again. I have maybe 200 LinkedIn connections but haven't talked to most of them in years. I want a low-effort system that actually works."

## Tips

- Start small: pick 10 contacts to maintain, not 200
- Consistency beats intensity, a 2-minute message quarterly is enough
- Giving is the best follow-up: share something useful, don't just "check in"
