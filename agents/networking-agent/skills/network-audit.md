# Network Audit

Understand your current network, identify gaps, and find the right people to connect with.

## Prompts Used

1. **assess-network** - Map current network across Dunbar's tiers, evaluate health
2. **identify-targets** - Define who to connect with based on goals and gaps

## Workflow

```
[Assess Network] → gaps and strengths → [Identify Targets] → prioritized action list
```

## When to Use

- Starting a new role or entering a new industry
- Feeling like your network is "good but not helpful"
- Before a career transition or major professional change
- Haven't thought strategically about relationships before

## What You'll Get

1. A map of your network across Dunbar's tiers (5/15/50/150)
2. Health assessment: diversity, seniority, industry breadth, reciprocity
3. Clear gaps relative to your goals
4. Prioritized list of 5-10 people or types of people to connect with
5. Approach strategy for each target (warm intro, event, online, direct)

## Example Input

"I'm a product manager at a mid-size SaaS company. I've been here 4 years and most of my network is internal. I'm thinking about moving to a bigger company or a different industry. I don't really know anyone outside my current org."

## Tips

- Be honest about the state of your network, this isn't a performance review
- Include dormant relationships, people you've lost touch with still count
- Think beyond your immediate company and role
