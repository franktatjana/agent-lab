# Outreach Campaign

Research a specific contact, craft a personalized message, and prepare for the conversation.

## Prompts Used

1. **research-contact** - Gather context and find common ground
2. **craft-outreach** - Write personalized connection messages
3. **prepare-conversation** - Develop talking points and questions

## Workflow

```
[Research Contact] → context + common ground → [Craft Outreach] → personalized message → [Prepare Conversation] → ready for meeting
```

## When to Use

- You've identified someone specific you want to connect with
- You're about to reach out to a speaker, author, or industry leader
- You've been referred to someone and need to make a strong first impression
- You're preparing for a networking event and know who'll be there

## What You'll Get

1. Research summary: career trajectory, interests, common ground
2. 2-3 outreach message variations to choose from
3. Conversation preparation: questions, things to share, closing strategy
4. Follow-up plan for after the interaction

## Example Input

"I want to connect with the VP of Product at [Company]. We have a mutual contact through my former colleague Sarah. I'm interested in their approach to product-led growth and I'd eventually like to explore opportunities there, but I don't want to lead with that."

## Tips

- Research enough to be informed, not so much that you're creepy
- The first message should be about them, not about you
- Prepare questions but be ready to follow the conversation naturally
