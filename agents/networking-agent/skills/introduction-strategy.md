# Introduction Strategy

Learn how to ask for, give, and facilitate warm introductions.

## Prompts Used

1. **request-introduction** - How to ask for intros and facilitate them
2. **craft-outreach** - Write the forwardable blurb and follow-up messages

## Workflow

```
[Request Introduction] → evaluate + prepare ask → [Craft Outreach] → forwardable blurb + follow-up
```

## When to Use

- You want to reach someone but don't have a direct connection
- Someone asks you to introduce them to a contact of yours
- You want to become known as a connector in your network
- You need to ask a mentor or sponsor for a strategic introduction

## What You'll Get

1. Assessment of whether a warm intro is the right approach
2. A polished ask that respects the connector's relationship
3. Forwardable blurb about you (ready to copy-paste)
4. Double opt-in introduction template for when you're the connector
5. Follow-up plan after the introduction is made

## Example Input

"My former manager knows the CTO of a startup I'm interested in joining. We have a good relationship but I haven't asked her for an introduction before. I don't want to put her in an awkward position."

## Tips

- Always give the connector an easy out
- Write the forwardable blurb yourself, don't make them do the work
- Close the loop: tell the connector how it went
- The best way to get introductions is to make them for others
