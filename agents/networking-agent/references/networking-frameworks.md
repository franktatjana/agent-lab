# Networking Frameworks

Core frameworks for strategic professional networking. These provide the theoretical foundation for the agent's approach.

## Weak Ties Theory (Mark Granovetter, 1973)

Your most valuable career opportunities are more likely to come from people you know casually than from close friends. Close friends tend to know the same things and people you do. Acquaintances, the "weak ties," bridge different social circles and bring novel information.

**Key insight**: Don't just invest in your inner circle. The people you see at conferences, former colleagues from years ago, and connections in adjacent fields are often more valuable for career opportunities than your best friends.

**Application**: When networking, prioritize breadth alongside depth. A diverse network with many weak ties surfaces more opportunities than a tight-knit group that all thinks alike.

## Give First Approach (Adam Grant)

Adam Grant's research in "Give and Take" identifies three reciprocity styles: givers, takers, and matchers. Givers who set boundaries (not doormats) are the most successful networkers long-term. They build goodwill, reputation, and a network that wants to help them.

**Key insight**: Give before you ask. Share knowledge, make introductions, offer help. The returns are disproportionate but delayed. Networking with a giving mindset builds stronger, more durable relationships.

**Application**: Before every networking interaction, ask "what can I offer this person?" Even if the answer is small, leading with generosity changes the dynamic.

## Dunbar's Numbers (Robin Dunbar)

Cognitive limits on how many relationships humans can maintain:
- **5**: Closest relationships (family, best friends)
- **15**: Good friends, strong professional relationships
- **50**: Active social network, people you regularly interact with
- **150**: Maximum meaningful social connections
- **500+**: Acquaintances you recognize

**Key insight**: You cannot maintain deep relationships with everyone. Tiering your network isn't cold, it's realistic. Invest accordingly.

**Application**: Categorize contacts into tiers and set appropriate touchpoint frequency for each tier. Monthly for top 15, quarterly for 15-50, bi-annually for 50-150.

## Network Mapping

Visual analysis of your professional relationships across dimensions:
- **Strong ties vs. weak ties**: Who do you talk to often vs. occasionally?
- **Structural holes**: Gaps between groups in your network that you could bridge
- **Cluster analysis**: Are your contacts all in one group, or spread across domains?

**Key insight**: The most powerful network positions are at the intersection of groups that don't otherwise connect. Being the bridge between communities gives you unique access to information and opportunities.

**Application**: Map your contacts by industry, seniority, geography, and how they're connected to each other. Look for clusters and holes.

## Personal CRM

A systematic approach to relationship management using tools and habits:
- Track who you know, how you met, and when you last connected
- Set reminders for follow-up based on relationship tier
- Note personal details that make future interactions warmer
- Review regularly to spot relationships going dormant

**Key insight**: Memory is unreliable. A simple system beats the best intentions. The goal is not to mechanize relationships but to ensure important ones don't slip through the cracks.

**Application**: Use a spreadsheet, Notion database, or dedicated tool (Clay, Dex, Monica). The best system is the one you'll actually use.
