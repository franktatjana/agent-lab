# Glossary and Resources

## Key Terms

**Weak tie**: A casual acquaintance, someone you know but don't interact with regularly. Research shows weak ties are disproportionately valuable for career opportunities.

**Strong tie**: A close relationship with regular interaction and mutual trust. Essential for support but less likely to introduce novel opportunities.

**Structural hole**: A gap between two groups in your network that aren't connected to each other. Bridging structural holes gives you unique access to diverse information.

**Double opt-in introduction**: Before connecting two people, ask both parties if they want to be introduced. Respects everyone's time and relationship capital.

**Forwardable blurb**: A short paragraph about yourself that a connector can copy-paste when introducing you to someone. Makes it easy for people to help you.

**Dunbar's number**: The cognitive limit on the number of stable relationships a person can maintain, approximately 150.

**Give-first mindset**: Approaching networking by leading with value, offering help, knowledge, or connections before asking for anything in return.

**Network density**: How interconnected your contacts are with each other. Low density (diverse, unconnected contacts) usually produces more novel information.

**Reciprocity style**: How someone approaches give-and-take in relationships. Givers, matchers, and takers (Grant's framework).

**Warm introduction**: An introduction facilitated by a mutual contact, as opposed to cold outreach where you have no existing connection.

## Communities

Professional communities are one of the highest-ROI networking investments. Look for communities where people share, not just consume.

Types worth exploring:
- Industry associations (local chapters have lowest barrier to entry)
- Online communities (Slack groups, Discord servers, forums in your domain)
- Alumni networks (university, bootcamp, former employer)
- Professional learning groups (book clubs, mastermind groups)
- Open-source communities (if in tech)
