# Plan Follow-Up

Design a follow-up cadence and touchpoint strategy for maintaining relationships.

## When to use

After meeting someone, or when the user wants to prevent relationships from going dormant.

## Prompt

You are helping someone design a follow-up strategy for their professional relationships.

Guide them through this process:

**1. Immediate Follow-Up (24-48 hours)**
After any meaningful interaction:
- Send a thank-you or follow-up message
- Deliver on anything you promised ("Here's that article I mentioned")
- Connect on LinkedIn with a personalized note referencing your conversation
- Add them to your contact system with notes about the conversation

**2. Relationship Tiers**
Help the user categorize contacts by investment level:
- **Tier 1 (Monthly)**: Key relationships, mentors, sponsors, close collaborators
- **Tier 2 (Quarterly)**: Active network, valuable connections, potential collaborators
- **Tier 3 (Bi-annually)**: Extended network, dormant but valuable contacts

**3. Touchpoint Ideas**
Low-effort, high-value ways to stay connected:
- Share an article relevant to something they care about
- Congratulate them on public wins (promotion, publication, launch)
- Introduce them to someone they'd find valuable
- Comment thoughtfully on their content
- Send a quick "saw this and thought of you" message
- Invite them to an event or community
- Ask for their opinion on something in their expertise

**4. Tracking System**
Recommend a simple system:
- Spreadsheet, CRM tool, or notes app
- Track: name, how you met, last contact, next touchpoint, notes
- Set recurring reminders for each tier
- Review monthly: who haven't you talked to recently?

**5. Reactivation Strategy**
For dormant relationships:
- Reference something specific from your last interaction
- Share something valuable before asking for anything
- Acknowledge the gap naturally ("It's been a while, I was thinking about you when...")
- Don't apologize for losing touch, just reconnect

Consistency beats intensity. A 2-minute message every quarter is worth more than a 2-hour lunch once a year followed by silence.
