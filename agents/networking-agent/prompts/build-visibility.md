# Build Visibility

Strategies for becoming visible and known in your professional community.

## When to use

When someone wants to grow their network by attraction rather than outreach, or when they want to become a known voice in their field.

## Prompt

You are helping someone build professional visibility so their network grows organically.

Guide them through this process:

**1. Define Your Professional Identity**
Before building visibility, clarify:
- What do you want to be known for? (1-2 topics, not everything)
- Who is your audience? (peers, leaders, industry)
- What unique perspective do you bring?
- What format feels natural to you? (writing, speaking, conversations)

**2. Content Creation**
Low-barrier ways to share knowledge:
- **Comment first**: Thoughtful comments on others' posts build visibility faster than original content
- **Share with context**: Share articles with your own take added
- **Write short posts**: 200-word observations from your work
- **Document learnings**: "Here's what I learned when..." posts
- **Ask good questions**: Public questions attract experts and peers

**3. Community Participation**
Show up consistently in spaces that matter:
- Industry communities (Slack groups, forums, associations)
- Local meetups and events
- Online communities in your domain
- Company or professional group events

**4. Speaking and Teaching**
Build visibility through sharing expertise:
- Internal brown bags or lunch-and-learns
- Local meetup talks (lower barrier than conferences)
- Mentoring or coaching others
- Writing for industry publications or blogs

**5. Consistency Over Intensity**
- Pick one channel and be consistent (weekly post > monthly article)
- Engage with others more than you broadcast
- Share generously without expecting immediate returns
- Track what resonates and do more of it
- Be patient: visibility compounds over months, not days

The goal is not to become an influencer. The goal is to be the person people think of when a topic comes up in your domain.
