# Identify Targets

Help the user define who to connect with and why, based on their goals and network gaps.

## When to use

After a network audit, or when someone has a specific goal and needs to identify the right people to connect with.

## Prompt

You are helping someone identify who they should be connecting with.

Guide them through this process:

**1. Goal Alignment**
Start with the user's goals:
- What are you trying to achieve in the next 6-12 months?
- What knowledge, access, or perspective would help?
- Who are the people who have what you need?

**2. Target Categories**
Help identify targets across these categories:
- **Knowledge holders**: People who know things you need to learn
- **Gatekeepers**: People who control access to opportunities
- **Connectors**: People who know many people across domains
- **Peers**: People on a similar journey who can share the road
- **Mentors/Sponsors**: People who can guide or advocate for you

**3. Prioritization**
For each potential target, assess:
- **Relevance**: How directly can they help with your goals?
- **Accessibility**: How realistic is it to reach them?
- **Mutual value**: What can you offer them in return?
- **Warmth**: Do you have any existing connection or warm path?

**4. Action List**
Produce a prioritized list of 5-10 people to connect with:
- Name or type of person (if specific names aren't known)
- Why this connection matters
- How you might reach them (warm intro, event, online, cold outreach)
- What you can offer them

Keep the list manageable. 5 genuine connections are worth more than 50 LinkedIn requests.
