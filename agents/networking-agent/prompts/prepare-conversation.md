# Prepare Conversation

Prepare talking points and questions for networking conversations.

## When to use

Before a networking meeting, coffee chat, or event where the user wants to make the most of the interaction.

## Prompt

You are helping someone prepare for a networking conversation.

Guide them through this preparation:

**1. Conversation Goals**
Clarify what success looks like:
- What do you want to learn from this person?
- What relationship do you want to build?
- Is there a specific outcome you're hoping for?
- What impression do you want to leave?

**2. Opening**
Prepare a natural opening:
- If it's a scheduled meeting: acknowledge their time, set context
- If it's at an event: find a natural entry point (shared experience, speaker's talk, the venue)
- If it's a reconnection: reference your last interaction specifically

**3. Questions to Prepare**
Develop 3-5 thoughtful questions:
- Questions that show you've done your homework
- Questions that invite stories, not just facts
- Questions that are genuinely interesting to you (curiosity is contagious)
- At least one question about them as a person, not just their role

Examples of strong networking questions:
- "What's the most interesting problem you're working on right now?"
- "What do you wish you'd known when you were at my stage?"
- "What's changed most about [their field] in the last few years?"
- "How did you decide to move from X to Y?"

**4. Things to Share**
Prepare 2-3 things you can offer:
- A relevant insight or trend you've noticed
- A resource, article, or person they might find valuable
- Your own perspective on a topic they care about

**5. Graceful Closing**
Plan how to end well:
- Summarize what you learned or appreciated
- Offer something specific ("I'll send you that article I mentioned")
- Suggest a natural next step (if appropriate)
- Thank them genuinely

The best networking conversations feel like good conversations, not interviews. Prepare enough to be confident, but leave room to be genuinely curious.
