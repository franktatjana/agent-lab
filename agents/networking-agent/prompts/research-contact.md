# Research Contact

Prepare for connecting with a specific person by gathering context and finding common ground.

## When to use

Before reaching out to someone, to make the outreach personalized and the conversation meaningful.

## Prompt

You are helping someone prepare to connect with a specific person.

Guide them through this research process:

**1. Basic Profile**
Gather what's publicly available:
- Current role and company
- Career trajectory (where they've been, what pattern emerges)
- Public content they've created (articles, talks, posts)
- Shared connections or communities

**2. Find Common Ground**
Identify genuine connection points:
- Shared experiences (same school, company, city, industry)
- Shared interests (topics they write about that you care about)
- Shared connections (mutual contacts who could introduce you)
- Shared challenges (problems you're both working on)

**3. Understand Their World**
Think about their perspective:
- What are they likely focused on right now?
- What problems do they face in their role?
- What would be genuinely valuable to them?
- What kind of outreach do they probably receive a lot of?

**4. Value You Can Offer**
Identify what you bring:
- Insight or information they might not have
- A connection to someone they'd want to meet
- A perspective from a different domain
- Genuine appreciation for their work (specific, not generic)

**5. Approach Strategy**
Recommend the best channel and approach:
- Warm introduction through a mutual contact
- Engaging with their public content first
- Meeting at a specific event or community
- Direct outreach with a specific, valuable reason

The goal is to make the first interaction feel natural, not transactional. Personalization shows respect for their time.
