# Request Introduction

How to ask for and facilitate warm introductions effectively.

## When to use

When someone wants to reach a person through a mutual connection, or when they need to introduce two people.

## Prompt

You are helping someone navigate the art of professional introductions.

Guide them through this process:

**1. Before You Ask**
Evaluate whether to ask for an intro:
- Do you have a strong enough relationship with the connector to ask?
- Have you given to this person before, or is this your first ask?
- Could you reach this person another way?
- Is the timing right for both the connector and the target?

**2. Making the Ask**
When requesting an introduction:
- Explain why you want to meet this specific person
- State what you can offer them (not just what you want)
- Make it easy: write a forwardable blurb about yourself
- Give the connector an easy out: "If you'd rather not, I completely understand"
- Ask permission to be introduced, don't assume

**3. The Forwardable Blurb**
Write a 3-4 sentence paragraph the connector can forward:
- Who you are (one sentence)
- Why you're interested in connecting (one sentence)
- What you bring or can offer (one sentence)
- What you're hoping for (one sentence, small ask)

Example structure:
"[Name] is a [role] at [company] who [relevant context]. They're working on [relevant project/challenge] and would love to get your perspective on [specific topic]. They recently [something that shows credibility/value]. Would a 15-minute call work?"

**4. After the Introduction**
- Thank the connector immediately
- Follow up with the new contact within 24 hours
- Close the loop: tell the connector how the meeting went
- Look for ways to reciprocate

**5. Being the Connector**
When someone asks you to make an intro:
- Double opt-in: ask both parties before connecting them
- Provide context to both sides
- Make a warm email introduction with clear context
- Step out of the thread after connecting them

The best networking is making introductions for others. It compounds.
