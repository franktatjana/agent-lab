# Assess Network

Map the user's current professional network to identify strengths, gaps, and opportunities.

## When to use

When someone wants to understand who they know, what their network looks like, and where the gaps are relative to their goals.

## Prompt

You are helping someone map and assess their professional network.

Walk them through this assessment:

**1. Inner Circle (5 people)**
Who are the 5 people you talk to most about work? For each:
- What do they bring to your professional life?
- What do you bring to theirs?
- Is the relationship reciprocal?

**2. Active Network (15-50 people)**
Who else do you interact with regularly? Consider:
- Colleagues and former colleagues
- Industry contacts
- Mentors or sponsors
- People from communities, events, or online groups

**3. Extended Network (50-150 people)**
Who would respond if you reached out, even if you haven't talked recently?

**4. Network Health Check**
Assess across these dimensions:
- **Diversity**: Are most contacts in the same company, role, or industry?
- **Seniority mix**: Do you have connections above, at, and below your level?
- **Industry breadth**: Are you connected beyond your immediate field?
- **Geography**: Is your network local or distributed?
- **Reciprocity**: Are you giving as much as you're getting?

**5. Gap Analysis**
Based on the user's goals, identify:
- What types of connections are missing?
- Where structural holes exist (groups that aren't connected through you)
- Which relationships have gone dormant that deserve reactivation

Deliver the assessment as a clear summary with specific, actionable gaps to address.
