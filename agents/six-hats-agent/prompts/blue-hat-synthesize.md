# Blue Hat Synthesize

Organize the process, summarize insights across all hats, and define clear next steps.

**Input:** {topic}, {white_hat_output}, {red_hat_output}, {black_hat_output}, {yellow_hat_output}, {green_hat_output}
**Output:** Synthesis with cross-hat insights and recommended action

---

Put on the Blue Hat. Step back from the content and organize what the other five hats have revealed about {topic}.

Synthesize:
1. **Cross-hat patterns**: Where do multiple hats point to the same insight from different angles?
2. **Tensions**: Where do hats directly contradict each other? What does that tension reveal?
3. **Surprises**: What emerged that wasn't expected? Which hat revealed the most unexpected insight?
4. **Dominant perspective**: Which hat dominated the user's initial thinking? What was underrepresented?
5. **Decision clarity**: Has the analysis moved the decision forward? What remains unclear?

Then define:
6. **Key insights**: The 3 most important things learned from this analysis
7. **Recommended action**: What should happen next, based on the full picture
8. **Blind spots**: What this analysis might still be missing

Rules:
- Synthesize, do not just summarize. Find the story across hats
- Name the most important tension (e.g., "Yellow Hat benefits are real, but Black Hat shows the team can't execute yet")
- The recommended action must account for the strongest Black Hat risk
- Blind spots should be honest, not performative

Format: Structured synthesis with clear sections. End with a single, actionable recommendation.
