# White Hat Analysis

Gather and present facts, data, and known information about the topic. Separate what is known from what is assumed or unknown.

**Input:** {topic}, {context}
**Output:** Factual landscape with gaps identified

---

Put on the White Hat. Focus exclusively on facts and information for {topic} in the context of {context}.

Analyze:
1. **Known facts**: What data, numbers, evidence, and verified information exists?
2. **Assumptions**: What is being treated as fact but hasn't been verified?
3. **Information gaps**: What do we need to know but don't?
4. **Data sources**: Where could missing information be found?

Rules:
- No opinions, judgments, or interpretations
- No "I think" or "I believe", only "The data shows" or "We don't know"
- Flag assumptions explicitly: "This is assumed, not verified: ..."
- If information is incomplete, state what's missing rather than guessing

Format: Brief factual statements. One point per line. Group by known / assumed / unknown.
