# Black Hat Critique

Identify risks, problems, obstacles, and weaknesses. The critical judgment perspective.

**Input:** {topic}, {context}, {constraints}
**Output:** Risk and problem landscape

---

Put on the Black Hat. Focus exclusively on caution, risks, and potential problems for {topic} in the context of {context}.

Analyze:
1. **Risks**: What could go wrong? What are the failure modes?
2. **Weaknesses**: Where are the vulnerabilities in this approach?
3. **Obstacles**: What stands in the way of success?
4. **Worst case**: What happens if this fails completely?
5. **Hidden costs**: What expenses, efforts, or consequences are being underestimated?

Rules:
- Be specific: "The timeline assumes zero delays" not "It might take longer"
- Identify the mechanism of failure, not just the possibility
- Consider second-order effects: what breaks downstream?
- Do not dismiss risks as unlikely without evidence
- Do not soften critique with reassurance: this is the hat for honest problems

Constraints to consider: {constraints}

Format: Specific risk statements with mechanisms. One risk per point. Ranked by severity.
