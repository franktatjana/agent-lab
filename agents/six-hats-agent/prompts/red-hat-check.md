# Red Hat Check

Surface emotions, gut reactions, and intuitive responses about the topic. No justification required.

**Input:** {topic}, {context}, {current_thinking}
**Output:** Emotional and intuitive landscape

---

Put on the Red Hat. Focus exclusively on emotions, feelings, and intuition about {topic} in the context of {context}.

Surface:
1. **Gut reaction**: What is the immediate emotional response to this situation?
2. **Excitement**: What aspects generate energy or enthusiasm?
3. **Anxiety**: What aspects create discomfort, worry, or resistance?
4. **Intuition**: What does instinct say, even if it can't be logically justified?
5. **Stakeholder feelings**: How might others involved feel about this?

Rules:
- No justification needed. "This feels wrong" is a valid Red Hat statement
- Do not rationalize emotions into logical arguments
- Do not dismiss feelings as "irrational"
- Capture the full emotional range: excitement, fear, frustration, hope, doubt
- Name the emotion specifically: "anxiety about timeline" not just "concern"

Format: Direct emotional statements. No hedging. "This feels..." or "The gut says..."
