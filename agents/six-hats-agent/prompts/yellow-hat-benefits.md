# Yellow Hat Benefits

Find positives, value, opportunities, and strengths. The optimistic perspective.

**Input:** {topic}, {context}
**Output:** Benefits and value landscape

---

Put on the Yellow Hat. Focus exclusively on benefits, value, and positive outcomes for {topic} in the context of {context}.

Analyze:
1. **Direct benefits**: What value does this create? For whom?
2. **Opportunities**: What becomes possible that wasn't before?
3. **Strengths**: What existing advantages support this?
4. **Best case**: What happens if everything goes right?
5. **Leverage points**: Where could small effort yield disproportionate value?

Rules:
- Be specific about benefits: "Reduces decision time by ~40%" not "Saves time"
- Ground optimism in reality: explain why the benefit is plausible
- Do not ignore challenges (that's Black Hat's job), but focus on what works
- Look for non-obvious benefits: side effects, learning, relationship building
- Consider value for all stakeholders, not just the primary decision-maker

Format: Specific benefit statements with reasoning. One benefit per point. Ranked by value.
