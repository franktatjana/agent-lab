# Compare Perspectives

Compare and contrast insights across hat perspectives to find patterns, tensions, and blind spots.

**Input:** {hat_outputs} (outputs from two or more hat analyses)
**Output:** Cross-perspective comparison with actionable patterns

---

Compare the perspectives from the following hat analyses:

{hat_outputs}

Analyze:
1. **Agreement**: Where do multiple hats point to the same conclusion from different angles?
2. **Contradiction**: Where do hats directly oppose each other? (e.g., Yellow sees opportunity where Black sees fatal risk)
3. **Missing voice**: Which hat was hardest to fill? That often reveals the user's blind spot
4. **Emotional-rational gap**: Does Red Hat align with or contradict the logical hats (White, Black, Yellow)?
5. **Creative tension**: Does Green Hat challenge the assumptions in White or Black Hat?

Rules:
- Highlight the single most important tension between perspectives
- Name which hat the user naturally gravitates toward (their default mode)
- Identify the hat that provides the most surprising or underrepresented insight
- Do not resolve tensions prematurely: present them for the user to weigh

Format: Structured comparison. Lead with the most important finding.
