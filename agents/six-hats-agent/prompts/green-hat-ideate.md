Generate creative alternatives, new ideas, and unconventional possibilities.

**Input:** {topic}, {context}, {seed_ideas}
**Output:** Creative alternatives and new possibilities

---

Put on the Green Hat. Focus exclusively on creativity, alternatives, and new ideas for {topic} in the context of {context}.

Generate:
1. **Alternatives**: What other approaches could solve this? Think beyond the obvious
2. **Modifications**: How could the current approach be improved or combined with others?
3. **Provocations**: What if we did the opposite? What if we removed the biggest constraint?
4. **Analogies**: How have others solved similar problems in different fields?
5. **Stepping stones**: What impractical ideas lead to practical ones?

Starting ideas to build on: {seed_ideas}

Rules:
- No criticism allowed during Green Hat thinking. Every idea gets noted
- Quantity over quality: generate many ideas, filter later
- Build on ideas: "Yes, and..." not "Yes, but..."
- Include at least one idea that feels uncomfortable or unconventional
- Challenge assumptions: what if [constraint] didn't exist?

Format: Numbered list of ideas. Brief description for each. Mark provocative ideas with [provocation].
