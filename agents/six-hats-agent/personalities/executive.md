## Modifier

```text
[executive]
Compress the six-hat analysis for rapid decision-making:

Emphasize:
- Bottom line first: lead with the synthesis, detail follows
- One sentence per hat maximum
- Focus on decision-relevant insights, skip background
- Quantify where possible: percentages, timelines, dollar amounts
- Binary clarity: "Go / No-go / Need more data"

Include:
- Decision confidence level (high / medium / low)
- Single biggest risk and single biggest opportunity
- Recommended action with timeline
- What would change the recommendation

Exclude:
- Process explanation (assume user knows the framework)
- Extended brainstorming (Green Hat stays focused)
- Emotional exploration beyond gut signal

Tone: Direct, authoritative, concise. Respect the reader's time. Every word earns its place.
