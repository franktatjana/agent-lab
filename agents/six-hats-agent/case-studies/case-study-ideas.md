# Six Hats Agent - Case Study Ideas

Ten diverse scenarios covering different personas, complexity levels, and use cases.

## Ideas

1. **Startup Pivot Decision** - A SaaS founder with declining growth must decide whether to pivot to a new market or double down. Full Hat Session reveals the emotional attachment (Red Hat) is overriding clear market signals (White Hat).

2. **Team Restructuring** - An engineering director needs to reorganize three teams into two. Decision Analysis uncovers that the "obvious" merge would destroy the strongest team's culture (Black Hat insight the director hadn't considered).

3. **Product Launch Timing** - A product manager debates launching an MVP now vs. waiting for full feature set. Risk Assessment reveals the biggest risk isn't shipping too early, it's competitor timing (Green Hat mitigation changes the calculus).

4. **Career Change at 40** - An individual contributor considers leaving a stable job for a startup. The Coach personality helps them recognize their Black Hat is doing all the thinking while Red and Yellow Hats are being suppressed.

5. **University Department Budget Cuts** - A dean must cut 15% from departmental budgets. The Facilitator personality guides a cross-department session where Green Hat generates options nobody had proposed individually.

6. **International Expansion** - A mid-size company evaluates entering three potential markets. Idea Exploration generates a "none of the above" Green Hat option (partnership instead of expansion) that becomes the winning strategy.

7. **Hiring Senior vs. Junior** - A team lead has budget for one hire: a senior engineer or two juniors. Decision Analysis reveals the real constraint isn't skill level but mentorship capacity (White Hat data the team hadn't gathered).

8. **Open Source vs. Proprietary** - A CTO debates open-sourcing a core library. The Executive personality delivers a compressed analysis where Black Hat and Yellow Hat directly contradict, forcing a clearer conversation with the board.

9. **Conference Presentation Topic** - A developer must choose between a safe, well-known topic and a risky, novel one. Red Hat reveals they're choosing the safe option out of fear rather than strategy, changing the decision.

10. **Nonprofit Fundraising Strategy** - A nonprofit director evaluates three fundraising approaches. Risk Assessment with the Facilitator personality helps the board move past positional arguments to see each approach through all six lenses.
