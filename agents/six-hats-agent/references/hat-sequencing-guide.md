# Hat Sequencing Guide

Practical guide for choosing the optimal hat sequence based on situation type.

## When to Load

Load when determining hat order for a specific analysis, or when the user asks about why hats are sequenced in a particular way.

## Sequencing Principles

The order of hats matters. Each hat creates a context that influences what the next hat produces. Blue Hat always bookends the session (opens and closes), but the inner sequence is flexible.

**Principle 1: Facts before opinions.** White Hat early prevents arguments based on assumed facts.

**Principle 2: Feelings acknowledged before logic.** If emotions are strong, Red Hat early prevents them from leaking into other hats disguised as logic.

**Principle 3: Generation before evaluation.** Green Hat before Black Hat protects fragile ideas from premature criticism.

**Principle 4: The last hat before Blue carries the most weight.** Whatever hat immediately precedes the final Blue Hat synthesis tends to dominate the conclusion. Choose deliberately.

## Recommended Sequences

### General Exploration

**Blue > White > Green > Yellow > Black > Red > Blue**

Start with facts, expand creatively, evaluate positively, then critically, end with gut-check. Good default for most topics.

### Go/No-Go Decision

**Blue > White > Yellow > Black > Red > Blue**

Establish facts, make the case for, make the case against, check your gut. Clean decision structure.

### Problem Solving

**Blue > White > Black > Green > Yellow > Blue**

Understand the situation, define the problem clearly, generate solutions, evaluate the best ones.

### Crisis Response

**Blue > Red > White > Black > Green > Yellow > Blue**

Acknowledge emotions first (they're already present), then get to facts. Identify immediate risks, generate responses, find the path forward.

### Innovation Workshop

**Blue > White > Green > Red > Yellow > Black > Blue**

Establish what exists, then go wild with creativity. Check emotional response to ideas (excitement signals), evaluate benefits, then reality-check.

### Performance Review / Retrospective

**Blue > White > Red > Yellow > Black > Green > Blue**

Facts first, then feelings about the period. What went well, what didn't. End with ideas for improvement.

### Conflict Resolution

**Blue > Red (Party A) > Red (Party B) > White > Yellow > Green > Blue**

Both parties share feelings first. Then establish shared facts. Find shared benefits. Generate solutions together.

## Anti-Patterns

**Black Hat first**: Kills motivation before exploration begins. Reserve for risk-focused sessions only.

**Skipping Red Hat**: Emotions don't disappear when ignored; they contaminate other hats instead.

**Green Hat last**: Creative ideas without evaluation (Yellow/Black) are just a wish list.

**Only two hats**: "Let's just do pros and cons" misses the power of the full framework. At minimum, add Red Hat and Green Hat.
