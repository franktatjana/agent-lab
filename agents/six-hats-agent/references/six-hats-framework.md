# Six Hats Framework

Detailed description of each hat's function, common misuses, and interaction patterns.

## When to Load

Load when the user is new to the framework, when explaining hat interactions, or when the analysis needs deeper framework grounding.

## The Six Hats in Detail

### White Hat: Information

The White Hat is about discipline. It asks: what do we actually know, separated from what we believe? Most people mix facts with interpretations so thoroughly they can't tell the difference. The White Hat forces the distinction.

Common misuse: Presenting opinions as facts. "Everyone knows that..." is not White Hat. "Survey data from 2024 shows that 67% of respondents..." is White Hat.

Key question: "If we had to bet money on this being true, would we?"

### Red Hat: Feelings

The Red Hat gives emotions legitimate status in decision-making. In most business contexts, feelings are suppressed or disguised as logic. Red Hat creates a space where "I don't like this" is a complete statement.

Common misuse: Rationalizing emotions. "I feel this won't work because the data suggests..." is not Red Hat. The "because" belongs to White or Black Hat. Pure Red Hat: "Something about this makes me uneasy."

Key question: "How does this feel, without needing to explain why?"

### Black Hat: Caution

The Black Hat is the most natural hat for most people and cultures. It identifies risks, flaws, and problems. It is not negativity; it is critical judgment, an essential survival skill.

Common misuse: Overusing Black Hat and calling it "being realistic." Also: using Black Hat to kill ideas during what should be Green Hat time.

Key question: "What could go wrong, and how specifically would it happen?"

### Yellow Hat: Value

The Yellow Hat requires deliberate effort. Finding problems (Black Hat) is easier than finding value. Yellow Hat asks you to make the case FOR something, even if you're skeptical.

Common misuse: Shallow optimism. "It'll be great!" is not Yellow Hat. "This approach reduces onboarding time by approximately 30% based on similar implementations" is Yellow Hat.

Key question: "Why could this work, and what specific value would it create?"

### Green Hat: Creativity

The Green Hat suspends judgment entirely. Its job is to generate, not evaluate. Ideas produced under Green Hat are not proposals; they are raw material for later evaluation by Yellow and Black Hats.

Common misuse: Self-censoring during Green Hat time. "That's a stupid idea" has no place here. Neither does "That's impractical." Practicality is Black Hat's job.

Key question: "What else is possible? What haven't we considered?"

### Blue Hat: Process

The Blue Hat is the meta-hat. It does not contribute content; it manages the process. Which hat should we use next? Have we spent enough time on Green Hat? Are we ready to synthesize?

Common misuse: Using Blue Hat to control outcomes rather than process. The Blue Hat facilitates thinking; it does not direct conclusions.

Key question: "What have we learned, and what should we do with it?"

## Hat Interaction Patterns

**Yellow before Black**: When you need people to find value before poking holes. Prevents premature rejection of good ideas.

**Black before Green**: When you need to understand problems before generating solutions. Ensures Green Hat ideas are targeted.

**Red early**: When emotions are running high. Acknowledging feelings first prevents them from contaminating the logical hats.

**Red late**: When you want an honest gut-check after logical analysis. "Now that we've looked at all the facts and risks, how do you actually feel?"

**Green after Black**: The "yes, and" pattern. After identifying problems, immediately generate creative solutions. Prevents Black Hat from being the final word.
