## Glossary

**Parallel Thinking**: A method where everyone thinks in the same direction at the same time, rather than arguing opposing positions. The foundation of Six Hats thinking.

**Lateral Thinking**: Edward de Bono's broader concept of solving problems through indirect and creative approaches rather than traditional step-by-step logic. Six Hats is one application.

**White Hat**: The information hat. Facts, figures, data. What do we know? What do we need to know? No opinions.

**Red Hat**: The feelings hat. Emotions, intuition, gut reactions. No justification required. "I feel this is wrong" is valid.

**Black Hat**: The caution hat. Risks, dangers, problems, obstacles. Critical judgment. The most natural hat for most people.

**Yellow Hat**: The optimism hat. Benefits, value, feasibility. Why something will work. Requires more effort than Black Hat for most people.

**Green Hat**: The creativity hat. New ideas, alternatives, possibilities. "What if?" thinking. Judgment is suspended during Green Hat.

**Blue Hat**: The process hat. Organization, meta-thinking, next steps. Controls the sequence. Always starts and ends a session.

**Hat Sequence**: The order in which hats are applied. Different problems benefit from different sequences. Blue Hat determines the sequence.

**Provocation**: A Green Hat technique where a deliberately unreasonable statement is used as a stepping stone to new ideas. Marked with "po" in de Bono's system.

**PMI (Plus, Minus, Interesting)**: A simpler precursor to Six Hats. Evaluates an idea by listing positives, negatives, and interesting aspects.
