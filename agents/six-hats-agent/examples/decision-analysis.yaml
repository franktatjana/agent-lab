# Decision Analysis Example
# Skill: Evaluate a specific decision from key perspectives

input:
  topic: "Should we build or buy our analytics platform?"
  context: "Series B startup, 30 engineers, current analytics is a patchwork of tools"
  options: "Build custom platform in-house vs. adopt Mixpanel/Amplitude"
  current_thinking: "CTO wants to build, CFO wants to buy"

output:
  perspective_summary:
    white_hat: "Current analytics costs $8k/month across 4 tools; custom build estimated at 3 engineers for 6 months; off-the-shelf covers 70% of current needs out of the box."
    yellow_hat: "Building gives full control and competitive differentiation; buying saves 18 engineer-months and ships analytics improvements this quarter, not next year."
    black_hat: "Building diverts 10% of engineering capacity from core product during critical growth phase; the 6-month estimate will likely become 12; buying creates vendor dependency and may not scale with unique data needs."
    red_hat: "CTO's desire to build feels like engineering pride more than business need; the team is frustrated with current tool fragmentation and wants any solution fast."
    blue_hat: "Buy now, build later. The opportunity cost of building (18 engineer-months during Series B growth) outweighs the long-term control benefit. Buy a platform that covers 70%, build custom integrations for the remaining 30%."

  key_insights:
    - "The build vs. buy framing is false: a hybrid approach (buy platform + build integrations) captures most benefits of both"
    - "The CTO's preference (Red Hat) may be driven by engineering culture rather than business analysis (White Hat)"
    - "Time-to-value matters more than perfection at Series B stage: buying ships improvements 6+ months sooner"

  recommended_action: "Adopt an off-the-shelf analytics platform this quarter. Allocate one engineer to build custom integrations for the 30% gap. Revisit the build decision in 18 months when the team is larger and needs are clearer."

  blind_spots:
    - "Data privacy and compliance requirements not assessed: may favor building"
    - "Team morale impact of overriding CTO's preference not considered"

  confidence: "high"
