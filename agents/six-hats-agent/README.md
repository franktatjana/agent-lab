# Six Hats Agent

A structured parallel thinking facilitator that guides individuals and teams through Edward de Bono's Six Thinking Hats framework. Instead of arguing perspectives simultaneously, the agent separates thinking into six distinct modes, each explored one at a time, then synthesized.

## The Human Analogy

Think of a skilled workshop facilitator who asks a room to "put on the Black Hat" and think only about risks for five minutes, then switches everyone to "Yellow Hat" to explore benefits. The Six Hats Agent does this systematically, ensuring every perspective gets genuine attention before a decision is made.

## Value Proposition

Most thinking is reactive: we mix facts, emotions, and opinions in a single stream and call it "analysis." The Six Hats Agent forces separation, which surfaces insights that tangled thinking misses. Teams discover that their "logical" objections are often emotional (Red Hat masquerading as Black Hat), and that creative alternatives (Green Hat) only emerge when criticism is temporarily suspended.

## How to Use

**Quick decision check:** Describe a decision you're facing and select the "Decision Analysis" skill. The agent walks you through facts, benefits, risks, and gut-check before synthesizing.

**Team workshop:** Use the "Full Hat Session" skill with the Facilitator personality. Share the generated prompt with your team in any LLM, and walk through each hat together.

**Idea development:** Have a rough idea? Select "Idea Exploration" to expand it creatively, then stress-test it with Yellow and Black Hat perspectives.

**Risk planning:** Use "Risk Assessment" before launching a project. The agent systematically identifies risks, surfaces gut concerns, and generates mitigations.

## What's Possible

| Capability | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Full six-hat analysis on any topic | Available |
| Decision-focused analysis (4 hats) | Available |
| Creative idea exploration | Available |
| Risk assessment with mitigations | Available |
| Team facilitation mode | Available |
| Multi-session follow-up | Planned |
| Custom hat sequences | Planned |

## Multi-Agent Combinations

The Six Hats Agent pairs well with other agents for deeper analysis:

- **Research Agent** feeds White Hat with verified facts and data
- **Why Agent** deepens Black Hat analysis by tracing root causes
- **Generation Agent** can provide demographic context for Red Hat (how different groups feel)
- **Culture Agent** enriches all hats with cross-cultural perspectives on decisions
- **Storytelling Agent** turns Blue Hat synthesis into compelling narratives for stakeholders

## Problem

Decisions fail not because people lack intelligence, but because they lack structured thinking. Teams argue in circles because different people wear different "hats" simultaneously. One person pushes benefits while another raises risks, and the conversation becomes positional rather than exploratory. Important perspectives (especially emotions and creativity) get suppressed because they feel "unprofessional."

## Goals

- Help users explore any decision from six distinct, well-defined perspectives
- Ensure no perspective gets skipped or shortchanged
- Surface insights that only emerge when perspectives are separated and then compared
- Build the habit of structured thinking users can apply without the agent

## Non-Goals

- Making decisions for users
- Providing domain expertise (legal, medical, financial)
- Replacing human facilitators for high-stakes workshops
- Psychometric assessment or personality profiling

## Use Cases

- **Product managers** deciding feature priorities or strategic direction
- **Teams** resolving disagreements by separating perspectives
- **Founders** evaluating startup pivots or major investments
- **Individuals** making career decisions or life changes
- **Leaders** preparing for board presentations by anticipating all angles

## Ideas

- Hat-specific deep dives (30 minutes on just Green Hat for innovation workshops)
- Pre-meeting prep (run all hats before a decision meeting, bring the output)
- Retrospective mode (analyze past decisions through six hats to learn)
- Debate resolution (map opposing positions to specific hats, find common ground)

## Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Current):** Core six-hat analysis with four skills and three personalities

**Phase 2:** Custom hat sequences, multi-session follow-up, saved analysis history

**Phase 3:** Team mode with role assignment, integration with decision-tracking tools

## Open Questions

- Should the agent default to a specific hat sequence, or always use sequence-hats to determine order?
- How deep should Red Hat go? Emotions are valuable data but the agent is not a therapist.
- Should there be a "quick mode" that hits all hats in one paragraph each?

## Success Criteria

- Users report discovering at least one perspective they hadn't considered
- Generated prompts produce genuinely distinct perspectives per hat (not rephrased versions)
- Blue Hat synthesis adds insight beyond summarizing the other five hats
- Users return for subsequent decisions (indicates the framework is useful)
