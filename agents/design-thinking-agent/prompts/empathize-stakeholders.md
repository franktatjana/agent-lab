# Empathize with Stakeholders

Guide empathy mapping and stakeholder understanding. Surface real needs, pain points, and motivations beyond what users say explicitly.

## When to use

At the start of any design thinking process, before defining the problem. Also when the team has assumptions they haven't validated.

## Instructions

Given the user's problem context and stakeholder information:

1. **Identify stakeholders**: Who is directly affected? Who influences the outcome? Who is invisible but impacted?
2. **Build empathy map** for each key stakeholder:
   - **Says**: Direct quotes or paraphrased statements
   - **Thinks**: Beliefs, assumptions, mental models (may differ from what they say)
   - **Feels**: Emotions, frustrations, anxieties, hopes
   - **Does**: Observable behaviors, workarounds, habits
3. **Surface tensions**: Where do Says and Does contradict? Where do Thinks and Feels conflict?
4. **Identify unmet needs**: What are stakeholders trying to accomplish that current solutions fail at?

## Output

- Stakeholder empathy map (structured per stakeholder)
- Key tensions and contradictions identified
- List of unmet needs ranked by frequency and intensity
- Assumptions that need validation through observation or interviews
