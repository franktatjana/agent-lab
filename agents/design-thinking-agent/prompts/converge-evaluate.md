# Converge: Evaluate and Select

Cluster, rank, and select the most promising ideas from a divergent brainstorming session. Apply structured criteria to move from many ideas to a few worth prototyping.

## When to use

After divergent ideation, when the team has a large set of ideas and needs to select which ones to prototype and test.

## Instructions

Given a list of ideas from brainstorming:

1. **Cluster similar ideas**: Group ideas that address the problem in similar ways. Name each cluster.
2. **Apply selection criteria**:
   - **Desirability**: Do users actually want this?
   - **Feasibility**: Can we build/deliver this?
   - **Viability**: Does it make business sense?
   - **Novelty**: Does it offer something genuinely different?
3. **2x2 matrix**: Plot top ideas on Impact vs. Effort to identify quick wins, big bets, and long shots.
4. **Dot voting simulation**: Identify the 3-5 ideas with the strongest combination of desirability, feasibility, and novelty.
5. **Select for prototyping**: Choose 1-3 ideas to take forward. Include at least one "safe" option and one "stretch" option.

## Output

- Idea clusters with names and member ideas
- Selection matrix (desirability / feasibility / viability / novelty ratings)
- Top 3-5 ideas with rationale for selection
- What was deliberately left behind and why
