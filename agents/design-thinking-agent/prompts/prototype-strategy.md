# Prototype Strategy

Plan rapid, low-fidelity prototypes that test specific assumptions. The goal is to learn, not to build a finished product.

## When to use

After selecting ideas to take forward. The team needs to decide what to prototype and how to make it testable quickly.

## Instructions

Given selected ideas and the problem context:

1. **Identify assumptions**: What must be true for each idea to work? List the riskiest assumptions, the ones that would kill the idea if wrong.
2. **Choose prototype type** based on what needs testing:
   - **Paper prototype**: Quick sketches, wireframes (test flow and concept)
   - **Storyboard**: Narrative walkthrough (test the experience journey)
   - **Role play**: Act out the interaction (test service concepts)
   - **Wizard of Oz**: Fake the backend, real frontend (test desirability)
   - **Landing page**: Describe the offering (test demand)
   - **Concierge**: Deliver manually first (test value proposition)
3. **Define "just enough"**: What is the minimum needed to test the riskiest assumption? Resist the urge to over-build.
4. **Set success criteria**: What signal would tell you this idea is worth pursuing? What signal would tell you to pivot?

## Output

- Assumption list ranked by risk (what kills the idea if wrong)
- Prototype plan: type, scope, materials needed, time estimate
- Success/failure criteria: specific signals to watch for
- Build checklist: step-by-step to create the prototype
