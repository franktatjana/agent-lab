# Diverge: Generate Ideas

Facilitate structured brainstorming with quantity over quality. Suspend judgment, build on ideas, and explore the full solution space before converging.

## When to use

After framing the problem with HMW questions. The team needs to generate as many ideas as possible before evaluating any of them.

## Instructions

Given a HMW question and problem context:

1. **Set divergent rules**: Quantity over quality. No criticism. Build on others' ideas. Wild ideas welcome. Stay visual.
2. **Structured brainstorming rounds**:
   - **Obvious solutions**: What would anyone try first?
   - **Analogies**: How do other industries/domains solve similar problems?
   - **Constraints removed**: What if there were no budget/time/technical limits?
   - **Extreme users**: What would a power user want? A first-time user? Someone who hates the product?
   - **Opposite**: What if we did the exact opposite of current approach?
3. **Build and combine**: Take promising fragments and combine them into hybrid ideas.
4. **Capture everything**: No idea is too small or too wild at this stage.

## Output

- Raw idea list (aim for 15-30 ideas minimum)
- Ideas grouped by theme or approach
- 3-5 "wild card" ideas that challenge assumptions
- Hybrid ideas that combine elements from multiple concepts
