# Synthesize Observations

Turn raw empathy data, interview notes, and observations into actionable insights. Find patterns across stakeholders and identify the most important themes.

## When to use

After empathy mapping or stakeholder interviews, when you have raw data that needs structure and meaning.

## Instructions

Given empathy maps, interview notes, or observation data:

1. **Cluster themes**: Group related observations across stakeholders. Look for recurring pain points, desires, and behaviors.
2. **Identify patterns**: What shows up across multiple stakeholders? What is unique to specific groups?
3. **Extract insights**: Transform observations into insight statements using the format: **[User]** needs **[need]** because **[surprising insight]**
4. **Prioritize**: Rank insights by:
   - Frequency (how many stakeholders share this)
   - Intensity (how strongly it affects them)
   - Opportunity (how underserved this need is)
5. **Surface surprises**: What contradicts the team's initial assumptions?

## Output

- Theme clusters with supporting observations
- 3-5 insight statements in [User] needs [need] because [insight] format
- Priority ranking of insights
- Assumption challenges: what the team got wrong or didn't expect
