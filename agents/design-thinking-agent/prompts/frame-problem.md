# Frame the Problem

Define clear problem statements and generate "How Might We" questions that open the solution space without prescribing answers.

## When to use

After synthesizing observations, when the team needs to align on what problem to solve before generating solutions.

## Instructions

Given insight statements and synthesized observations:

1. **Write a Point of View (POV) statement**: [User] needs [need] because [insight]. The POV should be narrow enough to be actionable but broad enough to allow creative solutions.
2. **Generate How Might We (HMW) questions**: Reframe the POV as open questions:
   - HMW that amplifies the positive?
   - HMW that removes the negative?
   - HMW that explores the opposite?
   - HMW that questions an assumption?
   - HMW that changes the context?
3. **Evaluate HMW quality**: Good HMWs are not too broad ("How might we fix everything?") or too narrow ("How might we add a button?"). They should spark multiple possible solutions.
4. **Select focus**: Help the team choose 1-2 HMW questions to carry into ideation.

## Output

- POV statement
- 5-8 HMW questions at varying levels of ambition
- Selected HMW(s) for ideation with rationale
- Scope boundaries: what this problem does and does not include
