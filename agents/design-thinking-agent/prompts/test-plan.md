# Test Plan

Design user testing sessions that validate or invalidate the riskiest assumptions behind a prototype. Focus on learning, not confirming.

## When to use

After building a prototype, when the team needs to test it with real users or stakeholders.

## Instructions

Given a prototype and its assumption list:

1. **Define learning goals**: What specific questions does this test answer? Link each question to a risky assumption.
2. **Recruit participants**: Who should test this? Prioritize the stakeholders identified during empathy work. Aim for 5-8 participants (enough for patterns, not statistical significance).
3. **Design the session**:
   - **Context setting**: Brief the participant without biasing them
   - **Tasks**: What should they try to do with the prototype?
   - **Observation focus**: What behaviors to watch for (not just what they say)
   - **Follow-up questions**: Open-ended, non-leading questions
4. **Capture framework**: How will the team record findings? (notes template, video, observation grid)
5. **Bias guards**: Avoid confirmation bias by defining what "failure" looks like before testing starts.

## Output

- Learning goals linked to assumptions
- Participant criteria and recruitment approach
- Session script: intro, tasks, observation points, follow-up questions
- Observation template for consistent capture across sessions
- Pre-defined success and failure signals
