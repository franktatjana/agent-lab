# Full Design Sprint

End-to-end design thinking cycle. Walks through all five stages from empathy to validated learning, producing a complete design thinking output.

## Workflow

1. **Empathize**: Use `empathize-stakeholders` to map stakeholder needs, pain points, and motivations
2. **Synthesize observations**: Use `synthesize-observations` to extract patterns and insight statements
3. **Define**: Use `frame-problem` to write POV statements and generate HMW questions
4. **Ideate (diverge)**: Use `diverge-ideas` to generate a wide range of solutions
5. **Ideate (converge)**: Use `converge-evaluate` to select the most promising ideas
6. **Prototype**: Use `prototype-strategy` to plan rapid, low-fidelity prototypes
7. **Test**: Use `test-plan` to design user testing sessions
8. **Learn**: Use `synthesize-learnings` to decide next steps based on evidence

## When to use

- Starting a significant new initiative from scratch
- Rethinking an existing product, service, or process
- The team needs a structured end-to-end process for innovation
- Complex problems where jumping to solutions would be risky

## Inputs

- Problem space or opportunity area
- Stakeholder groups involved
- Constraints (time, budget, team, technology)
- Existing research or data (if any)

## Output

- Complete design thinking documentation:
  - Empathy maps and stakeholder insights
  - Problem framing with HMW questions
  - Idea landscape with selection rationale
  - Prototype plan and test design
  - Learning synthesis with next steps
