# Prototype and Test

Turn selected ideas into testable prototypes and learn from real user feedback. This skill covers prototyping strategy, test planning, and learning synthesis.

## Workflow

1. **Prototype**: Use `prototype-strategy` to plan the fastest way to test riskiest assumptions
2. **Test**: Use `test-plan` to design user testing sessions
3. **Learn**: Use `synthesize-learnings` to turn test results into decisions (iterate, pivot, or proceed)

## When to use

- You have selected ideas and need to validate them before investing further
- The team is debating whether an idea will work (test instead of argue)
- A previous iteration needs refinement based on new feedback
- Building confidence before committing resources to full implementation

## Inputs

- Selected idea(s) to prototype
- Key assumptions to test
- Available resources and time for prototyping
- Target users for testing

## Output

- Prototype plan with build checklist
- Test session script and observation template
- Assumption scorecard (validated / invalidated / inconclusive)
- Decision with rationale: iterate, pivot, or proceed
