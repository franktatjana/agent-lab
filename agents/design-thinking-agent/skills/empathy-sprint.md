# Empathy Sprint

Move from assumptions to validated understanding of your stakeholders. This skill walks through empathy mapping, observation synthesis, and problem framing in one focused session.

## Workflow

1. **Empathize**: Use `empathize-stakeholders` to build empathy maps for each key stakeholder group
2. **Synthesize**: Use `synthesize-observations` to find patterns and extract insight statements
3. **Frame**: Use `frame-problem` to define POV statements and generate HMW questions

## When to use

- Starting a new project or initiative and need to understand users
- The team is working from assumptions rather than evidence
- Stakeholder needs are unclear or contested within the team
- Reframing an existing problem from the user's perspective

## Inputs

- Problem context or opportunity area
- Known stakeholders (who is affected?)
- Any existing research, interviews, or observations
- Time and scope constraints

## Output

- Stakeholder empathy maps with tensions identified
- Insight statements in [User] needs [need] because [insight] format
- Prioritized HMW questions ready for ideation
