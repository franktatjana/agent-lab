# Ideation Session

Generate and evaluate ideas for a defined problem. Separates divergent thinking (generate many) from convergent thinking (select best), preventing premature critique from killing creative ideas.

## Workflow

1. **Frame**: Use `frame-problem` to ensure the HMW question is well-defined
2. **Diverge**: Use `diverge-ideas` to generate a wide range of possible solutions
3. **Converge**: Use `converge-evaluate` to cluster, rank, and select the most promising ideas

## When to use

- You have a clear problem statement and need creative solutions
- The team is stuck on a single approach and needs alternatives
- Brainstorming sessions keep converging too quickly on "safe" ideas
- Need to evaluate multiple solution directions systematically

## Inputs

- HMW question or problem statement
- Context and constraints
- Any ideas already on the table
- Selection criteria priorities (desirability vs. feasibility vs. novelty)

## Output

- Reframed HMW question (if needed)
- Full idea list grouped by theme
- Top 3-5 ideas with selection rationale
- Recommended ideas for prototyping
