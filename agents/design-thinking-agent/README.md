# Design Thinking Agent

Guides human-centered problem-solving through design thinking, helping teams move from empathy to testable solutions.

## What it does

The Design Thinking Agent walks you through the five stages of design thinking: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. It prevents the most common mistake in problem-solving: jumping to solutions before understanding the people you're solving for.

## When to use it

- Starting a new project and need to understand users before building
- The team is stuck on one approach and needs creative alternatives
- Brainstorming sessions keep converging too quickly on "safe" ideas
- You have an idea but haven't validated the assumptions behind it
- Rethinking an existing product, service, or internal process
