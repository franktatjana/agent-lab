# Design Thinking Frameworks

## Stanford d.school 5-Stage Model

The foundational design thinking process developed at Stanford's Hasso Plattner Institute of Design.

**Stages**: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test

- **Empathize**: Understand users through observation, engagement, and immersion. Set aside assumptions.
- **Define**: Synthesize empathy findings into a clear problem statement (Point of View). Frame "How Might We" questions.
- **Ideate**: Generate a wide range of creative solutions. Quantity over quality. Defer judgment.
- **Prototype**: Build quick, low-fidelity representations of ideas. The goal is to learn, not to build.
- **Test**: Put prototypes in front of users. Observe, listen, refine. Test assumptions, not polish.

The process is non-linear. Teams regularly loop back to earlier stages based on what they learn.

## IDEO 3-I Model

IDEO's simplified three-phase framework for innovation.

**Phases**: Inspiration, Ideation, Implementation

- **Inspiration**: The problem or opportunity that motivates the search for solutions. Field research, immersion, analogous experiences.
- **Ideation**: Generating, developing, and testing ideas. Brainstorming, prototyping, iterating.
- **Implementation**: The path from project to market. Business model, go-to-market, scaling.

Key difference from d.school: includes implementation/business viability as an explicit phase.

## Double Diamond (UK Design Council)

A visual model showing the divergent and convergent thinking pattern that repeats twice.

**Four phases**: Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver

- **Diamond 1 (Problem space)**:
  - **Discover** (diverge): Explore the problem broadly. Research, observe, empathize.
  - **Define** (converge): Narrow down to the right problem to solve.
- **Diamond 2 (Solution space)**:
  - **Develop** (diverge): Generate many possible solutions.
  - **Deliver** (converge): Select, prototype, test, and implement.

The model emphasizes that teams must diverge before they converge, both in understanding the problem and in creating solutions.

## IBM Enterprise Design Thinking

IBM's adaptation of design thinking for large organizations and complex enterprise contexts.

**Three core practices (Loops)**:
- **Observe**: Immerse in the real world to understand users
- **Reflect**: Come together to synthesize and think about what you've learned
- **Make**: Give concrete form to abstract ideas to test and learn

**Three keys for scaling**:
- **Hills**: Statements of intent, written as meaningful user outcomes
- **Playbacks**: Regular alignment sessions with stakeholders
- **Sponsor Users**: Real users who participate throughout the project

IBM's model adds organizational practices that make design thinking work at enterprise scale, addressing alignment, governance, and stakeholder management challenges.
