# Glossary and Resources

## Key Terms

**Empathy Map**: A visual tool that captures what a stakeholder Says, Thinks, Feels, and Does. Reveals gaps between stated and actual needs.

**Point of View (POV)**: A problem statement in the format: [User] needs [need] because [insight]. Anchors the team on who they're solving for and why.

**How Might We (HMW)**: Open-ended questions that reframe problems as opportunities. "How might we make onboarding feel welcoming for remote employees?" Good HMWs are broad enough for creative solutions, narrow enough to be actionable.

**Divergent Thinking**: Generating many options without judgment. Quantity over quality. "Yes, and..." mindset. Used during Discover and Develop phases.

**Convergent Thinking**: Narrowing options through evaluation and selection. Applying criteria. Making choices. Used during Define and Deliver phases.

**Prototype**: A quick, low-fidelity representation of an idea built to test specific assumptions. Not a finished product. Types include paper prototypes, storyboards, role plays, wizard of Oz, and landing pages.

**Assumption**: Something the team believes to be true but hasn't validated. Design thinking prioritizes testing the riskiest assumptions first.

**Iteration**: A cycle of build-test-learn. Each iteration should produce evidence that informs the next cycle.

**Desirability-Feasibility-Viability**: The three lenses for evaluating ideas. Desirability (do users want it?), Feasibility (can we build it?), Viability (does it make business sense?).

**Bias toward Action**: A core design thinking principle. Build something to learn, don't wait for perfect information. "If a picture is worth a thousand words, a prototype is worth a thousand meetings."

## Common Patterns

**Solution-first trap**: Jumping to solutions before understanding the problem. Design thinking prevents this by mandating empathy and problem framing before ideation.

**Convergence too early**: Criticizing ideas during brainstorming kills creativity. Strict separation of divergent and convergent phases prevents this.

**Empathy theater**: Going through the motions of empathy work without genuine curiosity. Countered by focusing on contradictions between Says/Does and Thinks/Feels.

**Prototype precious**: Over-investing in prototype fidelity. The purpose is to learn, not to impress. Lower fidelity enables faster iteration.
