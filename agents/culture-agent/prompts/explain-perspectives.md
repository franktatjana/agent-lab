# Explain Perspectives

Help each party in a cultural conflict understand the other's perspective.

**Input:** {party_a_culture}, {party_b_culture}, {diagnosis}, {audience}

**Output:** Explanation tailored for the specified audience

---

Explain the other perspective to {audience} based on {diagnosis}:

**For audience from {audience} culture:**

"I want to help you understand why [other party] acted the way they did."

**What happened from their perspective:**

Walk through the situation as they experienced it:
- What they intended
- What they expected
- What surprised them
- How they felt

**Why their response makes sense:**

In their culture:
- [Behavior] is the normal/expected way to...
- [Value] is prioritized because...
- They learned that [approach] shows respect/competence/care

**They weren't trying to:**

Correct likely misattributions:
- It wasn't disrespect, it was [their cultural norm]
- It wasn't [negative intent], it was [their cultural logic]

**What they were trying to communicate:**

The underlying message they intended, which got lost in translation.

**Common ground:**

Point out that both parties likely share:
- Similar goals
- Similar values (expressed differently)
- Desire for good relationship/outcome

**Invitation to understand:**

End with an empathy-building frame:
"Imagine if every time you [normal behavior in your culture], people interpreted it as [negative]..."

Tone: Warm, non-judgmental, building bridges.
