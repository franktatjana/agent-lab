# Detect Friction

Identify potential misunderstanding points between two cultural profiles.

**Input:** {source_profile}, {target_profile}, {context}

**Output:** List of friction points with explanations

---

Compare {source_profile} and {target_profile} to identify friction points in {context}:

For each dimension where cultures differ significantly:

1. **Name the gap**: Which dimension shows meaningful difference?
2. **Describe the clash**: How might this difference manifest?
3. **Give an example**: Concrete scenario where misunderstanding could occur
4. **Rate severity**: High/Medium/Low impact on communication

Focus on:
- Communication style mismatches
- Hierarchy and decision-making expectations
- Time and scheduling norms
- Trust-building approaches
- Feedback and disagreement styles

Order friction points by severity (highest first).

Output as structured list. No generic statements: be specific to these cultures.
