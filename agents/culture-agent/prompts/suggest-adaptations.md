# Suggest Adaptations

Provide specific, actionable recommendations for adapting to a target culture.

**Input:** {your_culture}, {target_culture}, {context}, {gaps}

**Output:** Do's, don'ts, and specific behaviors

---

Based on {gaps} between {your_culture} and {target_culture} in {context}, provide adaptations:

**Do's:**

Specific behaviors to adopt. Be concrete:
- Not "be respectful" but "wait 2-3 seconds after they finish speaking before responding"
- Not "be formal" but "use titles and last names until invited to use first names"

**Don'ts:**

Specific behaviors to avoid. Be concrete:
- Not "don't be rude" but "don't interrupt even if you're excited to agree"
- Not "don't be informal" but "don't use humor in initial business meetings"

**Language adaptations:**

Specific phrases to use or avoid:
- Instead of "I disagree" → [culturally appropriate alternative]
- Instead of "This won't work" → [culturally appropriate alternative]

**Non-verbal adjustments:**

- Eye contact norms
- Personal space expectations
- Gesture meanings to be aware of

**Recovery phrases:**

If you accidentally cause friction, phrases to repair:
- "I may have expressed that in a way that didn't translate well..."
- [Culture-specific apology/clarification forms]

Make recommendations specific and memorable. Generic advice is not useful.
