# Reframe Message

Adapt a message from source culture style to target culture style while preserving intent.

**Input:** {message}, {source_culture}, {target_culture}, {context}

**Output:** Reframed message with explanation

---

Reframe this message from {source_culture} style to {target_culture} style:

Original message:
{message}

Context: {context}

**Analysis:**

1. **Intent**: What is the sender trying to accomplish?
2. **Source style**: How does source culture typically express this?
3. **Target expectations**: What would target culture expect/appreciate?
4. **Adaptation needed**: What specifically needs to change?

**Reframed message:**

Write the adapted message that:
- Preserves the original intent completely
- Uses communication patterns natural to {target_culture}
- Avoids elements that would cause friction
- Feels authentic, not robotic or over-adapted

**Explanation:**

Briefly explain what changed and why. Help the sender understand the adaptation.

Do NOT:
- Change the core message or weaken the intent
- Over-adapt to the point of losing meaning
- Add content the sender didn't intend
