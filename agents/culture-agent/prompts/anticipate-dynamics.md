# Anticipate Dynamics

Predict how a cross-cultural meeting or interaction will likely flow.

**Input:** {your_culture}, {counterpart_culture}, {meeting_type}, {context}

**Output:** Expected dynamics and what to prepare for

---

Predict the dynamics of {meeting_type} between {your_culture} and {counterpart_culture} in {context}:

**Meeting flow expectations:**

From your perspective:
- What you'll likely expect to happen
- How you'll naturally want to behave

From counterpart perspective:
- What they'll likely expect
- How they'll naturally behave

**Potential surprises:**

Things that might catch you off guard:
- Pace (faster/slower than expected?)
- Formality level
- Decision-making process
- How agreement/disagreement is expressed

**Critical moments:**

Points where cultural friction is most likely:
1. Opening: How the meeting starts
2. Agenda: How structured vs. flexible
3. Discussion: How ideas are challenged
4. Decision: How conclusions are reached
5. Closing: How commitments are expressed

**Signs to watch for:**

How will you know if:
- They're interested (may differ from your culture)
- They disagree (may not be explicit)
- They need more time (may not say so directly)
- They're ready to commit (may express differently)

Be specific to these cultures. Generic meeting advice is not useful.
