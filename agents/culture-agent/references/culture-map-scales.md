# Erin Meyer's Culture Map

Eight scales for mapping cultural differences in business contexts. More actionable than Hofstede for day-to-day work interactions.

## When to Load

- Preparing for cross-cultural business meetings
- Diagnosing communication breakdowns
- Coaching individuals on cultural adaptation

## The Eight Scales

### 1. Communicating: Low-Context vs High-Context

How explicitly messages are conveyed.

| Low-Context | High-Context |
|-------------|--------------|
| Explicit, literal, precise | Implicit, layered, reading between lines |
| Say what you mean | Meaning is in context, not just words |
| US, Australia, Netherlands, Germany | Japan, Korea, China, Indonesia |

**Watch for:** Low-context person may over-explain and seem condescending; high-context person may seem vague or evasive.

### 2. Evaluating: Direct Negative Feedback vs Indirect Negative Feedback

How criticism is delivered.

| Direct | Indirect |
|--------|----------|
| Frank, honest criticism | Wrapped in positives, softened |
| "This is wrong" | "This is interesting, but perhaps..." |
| Netherlands, Russia, Israel, Germany | Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, China |

**Watch for:** Direct feedback may feel brutal; indirect feedback may not register as criticism at all.

**Important:** Communicating and Evaluating are independent. Germans are low-context (explicit) but direct with feedback. Americans are low-context but indirect with negative feedback.

### 3. Persuading: Principles-First vs Applications-First

How people build arguments.

| Principles-First | Applications-First |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Theory → conclusion, why before what | Examples → conclusion, what before why |
| Deductive reasoning valued | Practical results valued |
| France, Italy, Spain, Russia | US, Canada, Australia, UK |

**Watch for:** Principles-first person may seem theoretical or slow; applications-first person may seem superficial.

### 4. Leading: Egalitarian vs Hierarchical

Attitudes toward authority and leadership.

| Egalitarian | Hierarchical |
|-------------|--------------|
| Flat structures, first names | Clear hierarchy, titles matter |
| Challenge the boss acceptable | Defer to authority |
| Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden, Australia | Japan, Korea, China, Nigeria |

**Watch for:** Egalitarian leader may seem weak; hierarchical leader may seem authoritarian.

### 5. Deciding: Consensual vs Top-Down

How decisions are made.

| Consensual | Top-Down |
|------------|----------|
| Group agreement before action | Leader decides, others follow |
| Slow to decide, fast to implement | Fast to decide, may revisit |
| Japan, Sweden, Netherlands, Germany | US, China, India, Nigeria |

**Watch for:** Consensual culture may seem slow; top-down culture may seem autocratic. Note: Germany is hierarchical in Leading but consensual in Deciding.

### 6. Trusting: Task-Based vs Relationship-Based

How trust is built.

| Task-Based | Relationship-Based |
|------------|---------------------|
| Trust from work competence | Trust from personal connection |
| Business first, relationship follows | Relationship first, business follows |
| US, Netherlands, Denmark, Germany | China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria |

**Watch for:** Task-based person may seem cold; relationship-based person may seem inefficient or nepotistic.

### 7. Disagreeing: Confrontational vs Avoids Confrontation

How comfortable people are with open disagreement.

| Confrontational | Avoids Confrontation |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Debate is positive, doesn't damage relationships | Disagreement threatens harmony |
| France, Israel, Germany, Netherlands | Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, China |

**Watch for:** Confrontational person may seem aggressive; conflict-avoiding person may seem passive or dishonest.

### 8. Scheduling: Linear-Time vs Flexible-Time

How time and schedules are treated.

| Linear-Time | Flexible-Time |
|-------------|---------------|
| Punctuality valued, one thing at a time | Schedules are guides, multitasking normal |
| Time is money | Relationships trump schedules |
| Germany, Switzerland, Japan, UK | Saudi Arabia, India, Nigeria, Kenya |

**Watch for:** Linear-time person may seem rigid; flexible-time person may seem disrespectful or chaotic.

## Using This Framework

1. **Map both parties**: Identify where each person/culture falls on relevant scales
2. **Find the gaps**: Biggest gaps create biggest friction
3. **Name the pattern**: "You value direct feedback; they hear it as attack"
4. **Suggest adaptations**: Both sides can flex toward the middle
5. **Note asymmetric scales**: Some dimensions matter more in specific contexts

## Key Insight

Cultures are not "better" or "worse", they're different. The goal is not to judge but to understand and adapt.
