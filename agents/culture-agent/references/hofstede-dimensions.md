# Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions

Framework for analyzing national cultures across six dimensions. Use this to identify where cultural friction may arise.

## When to Load

- Comparing cultures from different countries
- Analyzing organizational behavior in multinational contexts
- Identifying root causes of cross-cultural misunderstandings

## The Six Dimensions

### Power Distance Index (PDI)

How society handles inequality. High PDI cultures accept hierarchical order; low PDI cultures strive for equality.

| Score | Characteristics | Examples |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| High (70+) | Respect for hierarchy, formal titles matter, decisions flow top-down | Malaysia, Mexico, China, Russia |
| Low (30-) | Flat structures, challenge authority acceptable, participative decisions | Austria, Israel, Denmark, New Zealand |

**Friction points:** High-PDI person may seem deferential or passive to low-PDI colleague; low-PDI person may seem disrespectful to high-PDI colleague.

### Individualism vs Collectivism (IDV)

The degree to which people are integrated into groups.

| Score | Characteristics | Examples |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Individualist (70+) | "I" identity, personal achievement, direct communication | US, Australia, UK, Netherlands |
| Collectivist (30-) | "We" identity, group harmony, indirect communication | Guatemala, China, Japan, South Korea |

**Friction points:** Individualist may seem self-centered; collectivist may seem evasive or non-committal.

### Masculinity vs Femininity (MAS)

Preference for achievement/assertiveness vs cooperation/modesty.

| Score | Characteristics | Examples |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Masculine (70+) | Competition valued, work-life separation, assertive | Japan, Hungary, Austria, Italy |
| Feminine (30-) | Cooperation valued, work-life balance, consensus | Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, Denmark |

**Friction points:** Masculine culture may seem aggressive; feminine culture may seem indecisive.

### Uncertainty Avoidance Index (UAI)

Society's tolerance for ambiguity and unknown situations.

| Score | Characteristics | Examples |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| High (70+) | Need for rules, detailed planning, risk-averse | Greece, Portugal, Japan, Belgium |
| Low (30-) | Comfort with ambiguity, flexible, pragmatic | Singapore, Denmark, Sweden, UK |

**Friction points:** High-UAI person may seem rigid or bureaucratic; low-UAI person may seem reckless or unprepared.

### Long-Term vs Short-Term Orientation (LTO)

How society maintains links with its past while dealing with present and future challenges.

| Score | Characteristics | Examples |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Long-term (70+) | Persistence, thrift, adapting traditions | China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan |
| Short-term (30-) | Respect traditions, quick results, spending | US, UK, Australia, Nigeria |

**Friction points:** Long-term oriented may seem slow or evasive; short-term oriented may seem impatient or shallow.

### Indulgence vs Restraint (IVR)

The extent to which people try to control their desires and impulses.

| Score | Characteristics | Examples |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Indulgent (70+) | Enjoy life, optimistic, leisure matters | Mexico, Nigeria, US, Australia |
| Restrained (30-) | Control gratification, pessimistic, duty-focused | Russia, China, India, Eastern Europe |

**Friction points:** Indulgent culture may seem frivolous; restrained culture may seem joyless or rigid.

## Using This Framework

1. **Identify the dimensions at play**: Not all six matter in every situation
2. **Note the gap size**: Small gaps (10-20 points) create less friction than large gaps (40+)
3. **Consider individual variation**: National averages don't predict individual behavior
4. **Look for interaction effects**: High power distance + high uncertainty avoidance creates different dynamics than either alone

## Limitations

- National averages mask regional, generational, and individual variation
- Scores are relative, not absolute
- Cultures change over time; data may be dated
- Business culture may differ from national culture
