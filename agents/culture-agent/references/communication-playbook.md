# Communication Playbook

How to apply the frameworks in practice. Three workflows for the agent's core skills (bridging, meeting prep, conflict resolution), plus checklists for message construction and meetings.

## When to Load

Load when executing `bridge-message`, `meeting-prep`, or `resolve-misunderstanding` skills, or when preparing communications for cross-cultural audiences.

## Workflows

### Cultural Bridging

Used when translating a message from one cultural context to another.

1. **Identify dimensions:** Map source and target cultures to frameworks (Hofstede, Meyer)
2. **Detect friction points:** Find where dimensions clash (e.g., direct vs. indirect feedback)
3. **Understand intent:** What does the sender actually mean? Separate content from cultural packaging
4. **Reframe for target:** Adapt delivery while preserving intent. The message stays, the wrapping changes
5. **Add caveats:** Note limitations and individual variation. Culture is a tendency, not a rule

### Meeting Preparation

Used when preparing someone for a cross-cultural meeting or negotiation.

1. **Profile counterpart culture:** Key dimensions and communication patterns
2. **Identify your blind spots:** Where your own cultural defaults may cause friction
3. **Anticipate dynamics:** How the meeting will likely flow (who speaks first, how decisions surface, what silence means)
4. **Prepare adaptations:** Specific behaviors to adjust (pacing, directness, formality)
5. **Plan recovery:** How to handle unexpected friction without derailing the meeting

### Conflict Diagnosis

Used when a misunderstanding has already occurred and needs resolution.

1. **Gather perspectives:** What each party experienced. Same event, different cultural lenses
2. **Identify cultural root:** Which dimension caused the clash (usually communication style or power distance)
3. **Explain both sides:** Help each party understand the other's cultural logic. Neither side is "wrong"
4. **Find common ground:** Shared goals despite different approaches
5. **Suggest resolution:** Path forward that honors both cultures without requiring either to abandon their values

## Pre-Communication Checklist

### Know Your Audience

- [ ] Identified the cultural background(s) of recipient(s)
- [ ] Checked relevant dimension scores (Hofstede, Meyer)
- [ ] Noted any individual context that might override cultural defaults
- [ ] Considered power dynamics and hierarchy expectations

### Assess the Context

- [ ] Identified the communication channel (email, call, in-person)
- [ ] Noted the formality level expected
- [ ] Considered timing (their timezone, their workday, cultural calendar)
- [ ] Determined if relationship-building is needed first

---

## Message Construction

### For High-Context Cultures

- [ ] Left room for interpretation: avoid over-specification
- [ ] Included context that shows understanding of their situation
- [ ] Used indirect language for sensitive topics
- [ ] Avoided blunt refusals: offered alternatives instead
- [ ] Checked for face-saving language

### For Low-Context Cultures

- [ ] Made the main point explicit and early
- [ ] Provided specific details, numbers, timelines
- [ ] Avoided ambiguity that requires "reading between lines"
- [ ] Stated expectations clearly
- [ ] Confirmed understanding explicitly

### For Direct Feedback Cultures

- [ ] Got to the point without excessive softening
- [ ] Avoided phrases that bury the message ("maybe consider...")
- [ ] Used clear language about what needs to change
- [ ] Didn't over-apologize before delivering feedback

### For Indirect Feedback Cultures

- [ ] Started with positives before any criticism
- [ ] Used softening language ("perhaps," "might consider")
- [ ] Avoided public criticism: delivered privately
- [ ] Left room for recipient to save face
- [ ] Used questions instead of statements where possible

### For Hierarchical Cultures

- [ ] Used appropriate titles and honorifics
- [ ] Addressed the senior person first/primarily
- [ ] Avoided bypassing hierarchy (cc'd appropriate people)
- [ ] Showed respect for their position
- [ ] Didn't put junior people on the spot publicly

### For Egalitarian Cultures

- [ ] Used first names if appropriate
- [ ] Addressed individuals directly, not through hierarchy
- [ ] Invited input and questions
- [ ] Avoided excessive formality that creates distance

---

## Meeting Checklist

### Before the Meeting

- [ ] Sent agenda with appropriate lead time
- [ ] Considered whether pre-meeting relationship building is needed
- [ ] Identified decision-makers and their roles
- [ ] Prepared materials in appropriate detail level
- [ ] Confirmed logistics account for cultural expectations

### During the Meeting

- [ ] Allocated time for small talk (relationship cultures)
- [ ] Watched for non-verbal cues (high-context cultures)
- [ ] Didn't mistake silence for agreement (many Asian cultures)
- [ ] Allowed time for internal consultation (consensual cultures)
- [ ] Checked understanding without being condescending

### After the Meeting

- [ ] Sent written summary of decisions and action items
- [ ] Followed up through appropriate channels
- [ ] Allowed time for internal alignment before expecting response
- [ ] Maintained relationship through appropriate follow-up

---

## Red Flags

### Potential Misunderstandings

- [ ] "They're not responding": May be consulting internally
- [ ] "They agreed but nothing happened": May have been polite agreement, not commitment
- [ ] "They keep asking the same questions": May be different stakeholders or uncertainty avoidance
- [ ] "They seem evasive": May be high-context or protecting face
- [ ] "They're being difficult": May be negotiation style difference

### When to Escalate

- [ ] Pattern of miscommunication persists after adaptation
- [ ] Situation involves significant business/legal/ethical stakes
- [ ] Power imbalance makes direct conversation difficult
- [ ] Cultural clash involves protected characteristics
- [ ] Human mediator/translator may be more appropriate
