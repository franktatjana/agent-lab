# Cultural Frameworks

The theoretical foundation the agent uses to analyze and bridge cultural differences. Four models, each serving a different purpose: Hofstede for national-level dimensions, Meyer for business interactions, Hall for communication encoding, Coyle for group dynamics.

## When to Load

Load when comparing cultures, diagnosing friction, or preparing cultural briefings. Most skills reference at least one of these frameworks.

## Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions

Six dimensions for analyzing national cultures. Best for identifying where cultural friction may arise at a structural level.

### Power Distance Index (PDI)

How society handles inequality. High PDI cultures accept hierarchical order; low PDI cultures strive for equality.

| Score | Characteristics | Examples |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| High (70+) | Respect for hierarchy, formal titles matter, decisions flow top-down | Malaysia, Mexico, China, Russia |
| Low (30-) | Flat structures, challenge authority acceptable, participative decisions | Austria, Israel, Denmark, New Zealand |

**Friction points:** High-PDI person may seem deferential or passive to low-PDI colleague; low-PDI person may seem disrespectful to high-PDI colleague.

### Individualism vs Collectivism (IDV)

The degree to which people are integrated into groups.

| Score | Characteristics | Examples |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Individualist (70+) | "I" identity, personal achievement, direct communication | US, Australia, UK, Netherlands |
| Collectivist (30-) | "We" identity, group harmony, indirect communication | Guatemala, China, Japan, South Korea |

**Friction points:** Individualist may seem self-centered; collectivist may seem evasive or non-committal.

### Masculinity vs Femininity (MAS)

Preference for achievement/assertiveness vs cooperation/modesty.

| Score | Characteristics | Examples |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Masculine (70+) | Competition valued, work-life separation, assertive | Japan, Hungary, Austria, Italy |
| Feminine (30-) | Cooperation valued, work-life balance, consensus | Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, Denmark |

**Friction points:** Masculine culture may seem aggressive; feminine culture may seem indecisive.

### Uncertainty Avoidance Index (UAI)

Society's tolerance for ambiguity and unknown situations.

| Score | Characteristics | Examples |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| High (70+) | Need for rules, detailed planning, risk-averse | Greece, Portugal, Japan, Belgium |
| Low (30-) | Comfort with ambiguity, flexible, pragmatic | Singapore, Denmark, Sweden, UK |

**Friction points:** High-UAI person may seem rigid or bureaucratic; low-UAI person may seem reckless or unprepared.

### Long-Term vs Short-Term Orientation (LTO)

How society maintains links with its past while dealing with present and future challenges.

| Score | Characteristics | Examples |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Long-term (70+) | Persistence, thrift, adapting traditions | China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan |
| Short-term (30-) | Respect traditions, quick results, spending | US, UK, Australia, Nigeria |

**Friction points:** Long-term oriented may seem slow or evasive; short-term oriented may seem impatient or shallow.

### Indulgence vs Restraint (IVR)

The extent to which people try to control their desires and impulses.

| Score | Characteristics | Examples |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Indulgent (70+) | Enjoy life, optimistic, leisure matters | Mexico, Nigeria, US, Australia |
| Restrained (30-) | Control gratification, pessimistic, duty-focused | Russia, China, India, Eastern Europe |

**Friction points:** Indulgent culture may seem frivolous; restrained culture may seem joyless or rigid.

### Using Hofstede

1. **Identify the dimensions at play**: Not all six matter in every situation
2. **Note the gap size**: Small gaps (10-20 points) create less friction than large gaps (40+)
3. **Consider individual variation**: National averages don't predict individual behavior
4. **Look for interaction effects**: High power distance + high uncertainty avoidance creates different dynamics than either alone

### Limitations

- National averages mask regional, generational, and individual variation
- Scores are relative, not absolute
- Cultures change over time; data may be dated
- Business culture may differ from national culture

## Erin Meyer's Culture Map

Eight scales for mapping cultural differences in business contexts. More actionable than Hofstede for day-to-day work interactions.

### 1. Communicating: Low-Context vs High-Context

How explicitly messages are conveyed.

| Low-Context | High-Context |
|-------------|--------------|
| Explicit, literal, precise | Implicit, layered, reading between lines |
| Say what you mean | Meaning is in context, not just words |
| US, Australia, Netherlands, Germany | Japan, Korea, China, Indonesia |

**Watch for:** Low-context person may over-explain and seem condescending; high-context person may seem vague or evasive.

### 2. Evaluating: Direct Negative Feedback vs Indirect Negative Feedback

How criticism is delivered.

| Direct | Indirect |
|--------|----------|
| Frank, honest criticism | Wrapped in positives, softened |
| "This is wrong" | "This is interesting, but perhaps..." |
| Netherlands, Russia, Israel, Germany | Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, China |

**Watch for:** Direct feedback may feel brutal; indirect feedback may not register as criticism at all.

**Important:** Communicating and Evaluating are independent. Germans are low-context (explicit) but direct with feedback. Americans are low-context but indirect with negative feedback.

### 3. Persuading: Principles-First vs Applications-First

How people build arguments.

| Principles-First | Applications-First |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Theory → conclusion, why before what | Examples → conclusion, what before why |
| Deductive reasoning valued | Practical results valued |
| France, Italy, Spain, Russia | US, Canada, Australia, UK |

**Watch for:** Principles-first person may seem theoretical or slow; applications-first person may seem superficial.

### 4. Leading: Egalitarian vs Hierarchical

Attitudes toward authority and leadership.

| Egalitarian | Hierarchical |
|-------------|--------------|
| Flat structures, first names | Clear hierarchy, titles matter |
| Challenge the boss acceptable | Defer to authority |
| Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden, Australia | Japan, Korea, China, Nigeria |

**Watch for:** Egalitarian leader may seem weak; hierarchical leader may seem authoritarian.

### 5. Deciding: Consensual vs Top-Down

How decisions are made.

| Consensual | Top-Down |
|------------|----------|
| Group agreement before action | Leader decides, others follow |
| Slow to decide, fast to implement | Fast to decide, may revisit |
| Japan, Sweden, Netherlands, Germany | US, China, India, Nigeria |

**Watch for:** Consensual culture may seem slow; top-down culture may seem autocratic. Note: Germany is hierarchical in Leading but consensual in Deciding.

### 6. Trusting: Task-Based vs Relationship-Based

How trust is built.

| Task-Based | Relationship-Based |
|------------|---------------------|
| Trust from work competence | Trust from personal connection |
| Business first, relationship follows | Relationship first, business follows |
| US, Netherlands, Denmark, Germany | China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria |

**Watch for:** Task-based person may seem cold; relationship-based person may seem inefficient or nepotistic.

### 7. Disagreeing: Confrontational vs Avoids Confrontation

How comfortable people are with open disagreement.

| Confrontational | Avoids Confrontation |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Debate is positive, doesn't damage relationships | Disagreement threatens harmony |
| France, Israel, Germany, Netherlands | Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, China |

**Watch for:** Confrontational person may seem aggressive; conflict-avoiding person may seem passive or dishonest.

### 8. Scheduling: Linear-Time vs Flexible-Time

How time and schedules are treated.

| Linear-Time | Flexible-Time |
|-------------|---------------|
| Punctuality valued, one thing at a time | Schedules are guides, multitasking normal |
| Time is money | Relationships trump schedules |
| Germany, Switzerland, Japan, UK | Saudi Arabia, India, Nigeria, Kenya |

**Watch for:** Linear-time person may seem rigid; flexible-time person may seem disrespectful or chaotic.

### Using Meyer

1. **Map both parties**: Identify where each person/culture falls on relevant scales
2. **Find the gaps**: Biggest gaps create biggest friction
3. **Name the pattern**: "You value direct feedback; they hear it as attack"
4. **Suggest adaptations**: Both sides can flex toward the middle
5. **Note asymmetric scales**: Some dimensions matter more in specific contexts

### Key Insight

Cultures are not "better" or "worse", they're different. The goal is not to judge but to understand and adapt.

## Edward Hall's Context Model

The foundational model that introduced high-context and low-context communication. Meyer's "Communicating" scale builds on this.

**High-context:** Meaning embedded in context, relationships, non-verbal cues. The message is between the lines. A Japanese colleague saying "that might be difficult" may mean "no."

**Low-context:** Meaning in explicit words, contracts, direct statements. The message is the words. A Dutch colleague saying "I disagree" means exactly that.

**Key insight:** Most cross-cultural miscommunication happens when a high-context sender meets a low-context receiver (or vice versa). The message was sent, but in the wrong encoding.

## Daniel Coyle's Culture Code

Three key skills of highly successful groups, applicable across national cultures:

**Build Safety:** Signals of connection that generate belonging. People need to feel safe before they can do their best work. In high-power-distance cultures, safety signals look different (respect for hierarchy) than in low-power-distance cultures (informal access to leaders).

**Share Vulnerability:** Habits of mutual risk that drive cooperation. "I don't know" is powerful in egalitarian cultures but may be unacceptable for leaders in hierarchical ones.

**Establish Purpose:** Narratives that create shared goals and values. The story a team tells itself about why they exist. Cross-cultural teams need a purpose that transcends cultural differences.
