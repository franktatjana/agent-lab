# Conflict Mediation Example
# Skill: Resolve a cultural misunderstanding that has already occurred

input:
  source_culture: "Dutch"
  target_culture: "Brazilian"
  context: "Project feedback meeting escalated into conflict"
  situation: |
    Dutch manager gave direct critical feedback in a team meeting: "This proposal
    has serious problems. The timeline is unrealistic and the budget assumptions
    are wrong." Brazilian team members felt publicly humiliated and have become
    disengaged. Dutch manager is confused why the team is now unresponsive.

output:
  cultural_context:
    source: |
      Dutch culture is famously direct. Feedback is given straightforwardly,
      seen as respectful honesty. Public critique is normal and not personal.
      Efficiency valued over diplomacy. "Just say what you mean."
    target: |
      Brazilian culture values personal relationships and warmth (calor humano).
      Public criticism causes loss of face (vergonha). Feedback should be
      private, softened, and relationship-preserving. Harmony in the group
      is paramount.
    relevant_dimensions:
      - "Confrontation: Netherlands (very direct) vs Brazil (indirect, face-saving)"
      - "Individualism: Netherlands (80) vs Brazil (38) - group harmony more important in Brazil"
      - "Power Distance: Netherlands (38) vs Brazil (69) - public critique from authority feels harsher"

  diagnosis:
    root_cause: "Public direct criticism violated Brazilian norms around face-saving and group harmony"
    dutch_perspective: "I was being honest and efficient. Why are they taking it personally?"
    brazilian_perspective: "I was humiliated in front of colleagues. The manager doesn't respect us."
    gap: "Both sides have valid cultural logic; neither understood the other's frame"

  resolution_path:
    immediate:
      - "Dutch manager should have private one-on-one conversations with each team member"
      - "Acknowledge the feedback delivery may have felt harsh (without abandoning the content)"
      - "Express genuine appreciation for their work and commitment"
    ongoing:
      - "Establish feedback norms: critical feedback in private, praise in public"
      - "Dutch manager adapts delivery: 'sandwich' critique with positives"
      - "Team establishes safe channel for concerns (perhaps through a Brazilian liaison)"
    reframe_for_dutch: |
      Your feedback content was valid, but the delivery damaged trust. In Brazilian
      context, public criticism, even if accurate, signals disrespect. The team's
      disengagement is a rational response to what felt like humiliation. Rebuilding
      requires acknowledging the impact, not the intent.
    reframe_for_brazilian: |
      The Dutch manager's directness was not intended as disrespect. In Dutch culture,
      honest critique is a form of respect. They expected you to engage with the
      content, not the delivery. Understanding this doesn't excuse the hurt, but
      may help rebuild the working relationship.

  confidence: "high"

  caveats:
    - "Individual personalities vary: some Brazilians prefer directness, some Dutch are diplomatic"
    - "Organizational culture may override national patterns"
    - "Power dynamics matter: junior Dutch employee might not be this direct either"
