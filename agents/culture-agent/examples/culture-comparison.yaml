# Culture Comparison Example
# Skill: Compare two or more cultures across key dimensions

input:
  source_culture: "French"
  target_culture: "Chinese"
  context: "Joint venture negotiation"

output:
  cultural_context:
    source: |
      French business culture values intellectual debate, explicit disagreement,
      and logical argumentation. Hierarchy exists but ideas can be challenged.
      Relationship-building happens over meals and conversation. Directness
      is appreciated but delivered with eloquence.
    target: |
      Chinese business culture emphasizes relationship (guanxi) before business,
      indirect communication to preserve face, and hierarchical respect.
      Decisions involve consensus-building. Long-term orientation prioritizes
      relationship over immediate gains.
    relevant_dimensions:
      - "Power Distance: France (68) vs China (80) - both hierarchical, China more so"
      - "Individualism: France (71) vs China (20) - major gap, collectivist vs individualist"
      - "Communication: France (medium-context) vs China (high-context)"
      - "Confrontation: France confrontational vs China harmony-preserving"

  potential_friction:
    - "French directness in critique may cause Chinese partners to lose face"
    - "French impatience with slow consensus may seem disrespectful"
    - "Chinese indirect 'no' may be missed by French expecting explicit responses"
    - "French debate-style may feel aggressive; Chinese silence may feel evasive"

  recommendations:
    - "French side: soften critique, allow face-saving alternatives"
    - "French side: invest in relationship-building before pushing business"
    - "Chinese side: be more explicit about concerns with French partners"
    - "Both: clarify decision-making process and timeline expectations upfront"
    - "Both: use written summaries to confirm understanding after meetings"

  confidence: "high"

  caveats:
    - "Regional variation significant: Shanghai business culture differs from Beijing"
    - "Generational differences matter: younger Chinese executives may be more direct"
    - "Industry context affects norms: tech sector often more westernized"
