# Skill: Prepare a party for a cross-cultural meeting or negotiation

input:
  source_culture: "German"
  target_culture: "US"
  context: "First partnership meeting, video call"
  meeting_type: "kickoff"
  personality: "business"

output:
  cultural_context:
    source: |
      German business culture values thorough preparation, formal structure,
      punctuality, and systematic decision-making. Hierarchy is respected.
      Meetings follow agendas. Criticism is direct and factual.
    target: |
      US business culture values efficiency, optimism, and action-orientation.
      Communication is direct but wrapped in positivity. Meetings move fast.
      Informality is standard; first names used immediately.
    relevant_dimensions:
      - "Power Distance: Germany (35) vs US (40) - similar, but US more informal"
      - "Uncertainty Avoidance: Germany (65) vs US (46) - Germans need more detail"
      - "Communication: Both low-context and direct, but US adds positive framing"

  potential_friction:
    - "Germans may perceive US enthusiasm as superficial"
    - "US may perceive German thoroughness as slow or overly cautious"
    - "German direct criticism may feel harsh without US-style positive sandwich"

  recommendations:
    - "Germans: Add positive framing before critique"
    - "US: Allow time for German analysis; caution reflects thoroughness"
    - "Both: Clarify decision-making timelines explicitly"

  confidence: "high"

  caveats:
    - "Regional variation matters: Bavarians differ from Berliners"
    - "Company culture may override national patterns"
