# Cultural Bridge Example
# Skill: Adapt a message for a target culture while preserving intent

input:
  source_culture: "US"
  target_culture: "Japanese"
  message: "I think we should move faster on this. The current timeline is too slow and we're losing market share."
  context: "Email to Japanese partner"

output:
  cultural_context:
    source: "US directness, urgency-focused, individual accountability"
    target: "Japanese indirect communication, harmony-preserving, group consensus"
    relevant_dimensions:
      - "Communication style: US (very low-context) vs Japan (high-context)"
      - "Time orientation: US (short-term) vs Japan (long-term)"

  potential_friction:
    - "Direct criticism of timeline may cause loss of face"
    - "'We're losing' implies blame, threatening group harmony"
    - "Urgency framing may seem pushy and disrespectful of process"

  recommendations:
    - "Frame as shared challenge, not criticism"
    - "Acknowledge their perspective before suggesting change"
    - "Use 'perhaps' and 'might consider' rather than 'should'"

    Thank you for your continued partnership on this project. We greatly value
    the thorough approach your team brings.

    As we review market conditions together, we notice some competitive pressures
    that might benefit from our collective attention. Perhaps we could explore
    whether any adjustments to our timeline might help us respond to these
    conditions while maintaining the quality standards we both value.

    We would welcome the opportunity to discuss this at your convenience.

  confidence: "high"

  caveats:
    - "Relationship context matters: if trust is established, more directness may be acceptable"
    - "Industry norms may vary from general cultural patterns"
