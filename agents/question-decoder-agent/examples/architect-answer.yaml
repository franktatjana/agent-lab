# Architect Answer Example
# Skill: Structuring an answer for a board presentation Q&A

input:
  question: "What's our biggest technology risk right now?"
  who_is_asking: "Board member, former CTO, now investor"
  context: "Q&A portion of quarterly board meeting, 15 people in the room"
  facts: |
    Three main risks: vendor dependency on AWS for AI features (medium),
    technical debt in the billing system (high internal impact, low customer impact),
    and a single point of failure in the authentication service (high severity, being addressed).
    Auth service fix ships in 2 weeks. Billing refactor planned for Q4.
    AWS dependency is strategic and accepted.

output:
  audience_profile:
    role: "Board member, fiduciary responsibility, shapes strategic direction"
    expertise_level: "High, former CTO, understands technology deeply"
    preferred_format: "Structured with specifics, doesn't want things dumbed down"
    communication_style: "Analytical, respects precision, detects hand-waving"
    primary_concern: "Whether the technology can support the business plan; wants to see risk management, not risk absence"

  answer_architecture:
    format: "pyramid"
    depth: "summary"
    framing: "risk"
    lead: "Our biggest active risk is a single point of failure in authentication, and we're two weeks from resolving it."
    supporting_points:
      - "Name the top risk clearly (shows awareness and honesty)"
      - "State the mitigation and timeline (shows management)"
      - "Briefly acknowledge secondary risks to show comprehensive view"
      - "Close with the strategic risk posture (accepted trade-offs vs. active mitigations)"

  drafted_response: |
    Our biggest active risk is a single point of failure in our
    authentication service. If it goes down, users can't log in. We've
    built the fix and it ships in two weeks, after which we'll have
    full redundancy.

    Beyond that, we have planned technical debt in the billing system
    that we're addressing in Q4, and a strategic dependency on AWS for
    our AI features that we've accepted given the build-vs-buy
    trade-off.

    None of these threaten our ability to hit the targets we presented
    today.

  adaptation_notes: |
    This board member is a former CTO, so technical specifics are
    appropriate and expected. Don't over-simplify. The framing
    acknowledges risk honestly (builds trust) while showing each risk
    has a plan (builds confidence). The closing line ties back to
    business outcomes, which is what the board ultimately cares about.
