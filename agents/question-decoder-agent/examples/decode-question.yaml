# Decode Question Example
# Skill: Full decode of an ambiguous question with multiple possible intents

input:
  question: "What do you think about the new hire?"
  who_is_asking: "Engineering Director, hired the person, your skip-level manager"
  context: "Casual mention during a team lunch, the new hire started 3 weeks ago"
  relationship: "Quarterly interaction, professional but not close"

output:
  audience_profile:
    role: "Engineering Director, made the hiring decision, accountable for team performance"
    expertise_level: "High on engineering, high on people management"
    preferred_format: "Balanced assessment, not just positive"
    communication_style: "Values candor, reads between lines"
    primary_concern: "Validating their hiring decision; may have heard something"

  decoded_intent:
    literal_question: "What do you think about the new hire?"
    real_question: "Is my hiring decision working out? Should I be concerned about anything?"
    trigger: "Three weeks is the point where initial impressions form; director may be doing informal pulse checks"
    seeking: "validation with willingness to hear honest feedback"
    confidence: "medium"
    alternative_intents:
      - "May have received negative feedback from someone else and is cross-referencing"
      - "May be genuinely curious with no hidden agenda (lower probability given skip-level relationship)"

  answer_architecture:
    format: "balanced"
    depth: "summary"
    framing: "balanced"
    lead: "Strong start. They've already contributed to the code review process and the team seems to like working with them."
    supporting_points:
      - "Lead with a genuine positive (validates their decision without being sycophantic)"
      - "Add one specific observation (shows you're paying attention)"
      - "Include one growth area framed constructively (shows honesty without being negative)"
      - "Keep it conversational since it's a lunch setting"

  drafted_response: |
    Strong start. They've already contributed to the code review process
    and caught a subtle bug in the payment module last week. The team
    seems to like working with them. They're still getting up to speed
    on our deployment pipeline, but that's normal for week three.
    Good hire.

  anticipated_follow_ups:
    - question: "Any concerns?"
      prepared_response: "Nothing unusual for someone three weeks in. The learning curve on our codebase is steep for everyone. I'd check in with them around the six-week mark."
    - question: "How are they getting along with the team?"
      prepared_response: "Well. They pair-programmed with Sarah on the API refactor and it went smoothly. They ask good questions in standup."
    - question: "Would you have hired them?"
      prepared_response: "Based on what I've seen so far, yes. They're technically solid and collaborative. Ask me again at the three-month mark for a fuller picture."
