# Reframe for Audience Example
# Skill: Same answer reframed for 3 different audiences

original_answer: |
  We discovered a race condition in the payment processing pipeline that caused
  duplicate charges for approximately 0.3% of transactions over the past 48 hours.
  The root cause was a missing idempotency key in the async message handler.
  We've deployed a hotfix with proper deduplication logic and are processing
  refunds for all affected customers. Total financial exposure is $47,000.

# Reframe 1: For the CEO

input:
  answer: "(original answer above)"
  target_audience: "CEO, non-technical, presenting to investors next week"
  context: "Slack message, CEO needs the headline"

output:
  audience_profile:
    role: "CEO, external-facing, reputation-sensitive"
    expertise_level: "Low on technical, high on business impact"
    preferred_format: "Headline with impact and resolution"
    communication_style: "Big-picture, wants to know: is this handled?"
    primary_concern: "Customer trust, financial exposure, will this happen again"

  reframed_answer: |
    A billing error caused duplicate charges for a small number of
    customers (0.3%) over two days. Total exposure: $47K. It's fixed,
    refunds are processing, and we've added safeguards to prevent
    recurrence. No customer complaints have escalated. If this comes
    up with investors, the headline is: we caught it fast, fixed it
    same day, and all customers are being made whole.

  adaptation_notes:
    what_changed:
      - "Removed all technical terms (race condition, idempotency key, async handler)"
      - "Added investor-ready framing since that's the CEO's upcoming context"
      - "Led with impact and resolution, not root cause"
    what_was_omitted:
      - "Technical root cause details"
      - "Implementation specifics of the fix"

# Reframe 2: For the VP of Engineering

input:
  answer: "(original answer above)"
  target_audience: "VP of Engineering, technical background, owns platform reliability"
  context: "Incident review meeting"

output:
  audience_profile:
    role: "VP of Engineering, accountable for platform reliability"
    expertise_level: "High, wants technical precision"
    preferred_format: "Data-led with root cause and prevention"
    communication_style: "Analytical, wants to see systemic thinking"
    primary_concern: "Is this a one-off or a pattern? What's the prevention plan?"

  reframed_answer: |
    Root cause: missing idempotency key in the async payment message
    handler allowed duplicate processing under high concurrency. Impact:
    0.3% of transactions over 48 hours, $47K total exposure.

    Fix deployed: added deduplication logic with idempotency keys at
    the handler level. Refunds processing automatically.

    Prevention: I'm proposing we add idempotency checks as a standard
    requirement for all async handlers. We should also add a monitoring
    alert for duplicate transaction patterns, which would have caught
    this in under an hour instead of 48. I'll bring the proposal to
    the architecture review Thursday.

  adaptation_notes:
    what_changed:
      - "Led with root cause instead of impact (this audience wants the why first)"
      - "Added systemic prevention proposal (shows engineering maturity)"
      - "Included specific next step with timeline"
    what_was_omitted:
      - "Business framing (this audience thinks in systems, not revenue)"
    what_was_added:
      - "Monitoring gap analysis"
      - "Architecture review proposal with date"

# Reframe 3: For the Customer Success Team

input:
  answer: "(original answer above)"
  target_audience: "Customer Success team, will handle inbound questions"
  context: "Internal briefing to prepare for customer inquiries"

output:
  audience_profile:
    role: "Customer Success, front-line with affected customers"
    expertise_level: "Non-technical, needs talking points not root cause"
    preferred_format: "Script-ready language with Q&A"
    communication_style: "Empathetic, customer-first"
    primary_concern: "What do I tell the customer? How do I keep their trust?"

  reframed_answer: |
    What happened: A small number of customers (about 0.3%) were
    charged twice for a single transaction over the past two days.

    What we're doing: Every affected customer is receiving an automatic
    refund. No action needed on their part. The technical issue has
    been fixed.

    If a customer contacts you:
    - Acknowledge the error and apologize
    - Confirm their refund is being processed (2-3 business days)
    - If they want specifics: "A technical error caused duplicate
      processing. It's been resolved and safeguards are in place."
    - Do NOT promise it will never happen again; say "We've added
      additional safeguards to prevent this type of issue."

    Escalate to engineering if: a customer reports charges beyond
    the 48-hour window, or if the refund doesn't appear within
    5 business days.

      - "Refund timeline for customer-facing communication"
