# Anticipate Follow-ups Example
# Skill: Predicting follow-up questions from a skeptical stakeholder

input:
  question: "Why did the last release take three sprints instead of one?"
  who_is_asking: "VP of Product, skeptical, has been pushing for faster delivery"
  context: "Sprint retrospective, full team present, VP joined unexpectedly"
  answer: |
    The scope expanded after we discovered integration issues with the
    legacy API during development. We chose to fix the underlying problem
    rather than ship a workaround that would have created more work later.

output:
  audience_profile:
    role: "VP of Product, owns roadmap, accountable for delivery speed"
    expertise_level: "Medium-technical, understands enough to challenge"
    preferred_format: "Direct with data"
    communication_style: "Skeptical, results-oriented, impatient with excuses"
    primary_concern: "Engineering is too slow; other teams are waiting on this"

  follow_ups:
    - question: "Why wasn't the integration issue caught during planning?"
      why_likely: "VP of Product expects engineering to scope accurately; this sounds like a planning failure"
      prepared_response: |
        Fair question. The legacy API documentation was outdated, and
        the actual behavior differed from the spec. We've since added
        integration testing to our spike process so we catch these
        discrepancies before committing to a timeline. This specific
        scenario won't repeat.
      likelihood: "very likely"

    - question: "How do we prevent this from happening again?"
      why_likely: "Skeptical stakeholders want systemic fixes, not one-time explanations"
      prepared_response: |
        Two changes: first, we're adding a technical spike before
        any feature that touches the legacy system, which adds two
        days upfront but saves weeks of surprises. Second, we're
        documenting the actual API behavior as we go, so the next
        team doesn't hit the same gap. Both are already in our
        process as of this sprint.
      likelihood: "very likely"

    - question: "What's the impact on the roadmap? Are other features delayed?"
      why_likely: "VP of Product is thinking about downstream effects on commitments they've made to stakeholders"
      prepared_response: |
        The auth feature shipped on time because it doesn't touch
        legacy systems. The reporting dashboard is pushed by one
        sprint, and I've already flagged that to the stakeholders.
        Nothing else on the Q2 roadmap is affected.
      likelihood: "likely"

  worst_case_question:
    question: "Is this a team capability issue? Do we have the right people on this?"
    prepared_response: |
      The team executed well once the scope was clear. The issue was
      information quality, not team quality. The engineer who found
      the integration problem saved us from shipping a fragile
      workaround. I'd rather have a team that catches problems than
      one that ships them. That said, I'm open to discussing whether
      we need more legacy system expertise on the team.
