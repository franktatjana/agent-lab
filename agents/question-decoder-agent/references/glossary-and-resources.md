## Terms

**Decoded intent:** The real question behind the literal question. What the asker actually wants to know, which may differ significantly from the words they used.

**Audience altitude:** The level of abstraction at which someone processes information. Executives operate at strategic altitude (outcomes, risk, timeline). Managers operate at tactical altitude (plans, resources, trade-offs). ICs operate at operational altitude (implementation, details, evidence).

**Answer architecture:** The deliberate structure of a response, including format (pyramid, narrative, direct, data-led), depth (headline, summary, detailed), framing (risk, opportunity, balanced, progress), and opening line.

**Question behind the question:** The unspoken concern or need that motivated someone to ask a particular question. Identified through the escalation test, trigger test, and "what would change" test.

**Framing:** The lens through which facts are presented. The same project status can be framed as risk ("we have one unresolved dependency"), opportunity ("we're ahead on two of three milestones"), or progress ("three phases planned, two complete"). Framing shapes perception without changing facts.

**Cognitive load:** The mental effort required to process information. Answers that exceed the audience's available cognitive capacity fail regardless of accuracy. Match complexity to the audience's bandwidth and context.

**Curse of knowledge:** The cognitive bias where someone who knows something deeply cannot imagine not knowing it. Causes experts to over-explain, use jargon, and skip foundational context. The most common reason technical answers fail with non-technical audiences.

**Pyramid Principle:** Barbara Minto's communication framework: lead with the answer, support with grouped arguments, provide detail on request. The standard structure for executive communication.

**BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front):** Military communication principle: put the most important information first. Related to the Pyramid Principle. The recipient should understand the core message from the first sentence alone.

**Seeking type:** What the asker wants from the answer. Four types: information (genuinely don't know), reassurance (worried, want to hear it's fine), ammunition (need data to support a position), validation (already decided, want confirmation).

**Audience Analysis Matrix:** A grid mapping role types to their typical concerns, preferred formats, expected depth, and decision context. Used for rapid audience profiling when specific knowledge about the individual is limited.
