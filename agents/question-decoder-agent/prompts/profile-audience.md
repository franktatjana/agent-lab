# Profile Audience

Build a communication profile of the person asking the question, mapping their role to typical concerns, preferred formats, and decision context.

**Input:** {who_is_asking}, {relationship}, {context}

**Output:** Audience profile with communication preferences

---

Profile {who_is_asking} given {relationship} and {context}:

**Role Mapping:**

1. What is their role and what does that role typically care about?
2. What decisions do they make or influence?
3. What is their expertise level on this topic?
4. Where do they sit in the decision chain (final decision, recommender, influencer, observer)?

**Communication Preferences:**

1. Preferred format: Do they want numbers, narratives, recommendations, or headlines?
2. Preferred depth: Do they want the headline, the summary, or the full detail?
3. Tone expectations: Direct, diplomatic, data-driven, or conversational?
4. Formality: How much structure do they expect?

**Concern Mapping:**

1. What keeps them up at night regarding this topic?
2. What would make them satisfied with an answer?
3. What would trigger a follow-up or escalation?
4. What do they fear hearing?

For each assessment:
- Cite observable evidence (role, context, timing) rather than assumptions
- Note where individual variation is likely significant
- Flag when the profile is based on role stereotypes rather than specific knowledge

Output only the audience profile. Be specific to this person in this context.
