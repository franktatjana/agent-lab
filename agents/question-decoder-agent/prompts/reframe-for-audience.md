# Reframe for Audience

Take an existing answer and reshape it for a different audience, adjusting language, altitude, format, and tone while preserving factual accuracy.

**Input:** {answer}, {target_audience}

**Output:** Reframed answer optimized for target audience

---

Reframe {answer} for {target_audience}:

**Audience Adjustment:**

1. Strip jargon for non-technical audiences; add specifics for technical ones
2. Adjust altitude: strategic (board/C-suite), tactical (management), operational (teams)
3. Match tone expectations: formal, conversational, data-driven, narrative
4. Shift emphasis to what this audience cares about most

**Structural Adaptation:**

1. Change the lead to address this audience's primary concern
2. Reorder supporting points by relevance to this audience
3. Adjust depth: shorten for executives, expand for specialists
4. Change proof points to ones this audience trusts (revenue for business, metrics for engineers, user stories for product)

**Language Calibration:**

1. Replace domain-specific terms with the audience's vocabulary
2. Adjust confidence language (executives want certainty; engineers want precision)
3. Match formality level to the relationship and context
4. Preserve factual accuracy, never distort facts for framing

For each reframe:
- State what changed and why
- Flag if the reframe required omitting important nuance
- Note what follow-up questions this framing might invite

Output the reframed answer ready for delivery, with adaptation notes.
