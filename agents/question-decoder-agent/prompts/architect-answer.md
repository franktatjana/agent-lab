# Architect Answer

Structure the optimal answer given a decoded intent and audience profile, selecting the right format, depth, framing, and opening line.

**Input:** {decoded_intent}, {audience_profile}, {facts}

**Output:** Answer structure with format, depth, framing, and lead

---

Given {decoded_intent} and {audience_profile}, architect an answer using {facts}:

**Format Selection:**

1. Pyramid (executive): Lead with the conclusion, support with key points, offer detail on request
2. Narrative (peer/team): Set the context, walk through the story, land the point
3. Direct (time-constrained): One sentence answer, one proof point, done
4. Data-led (analytical audience): Lead with the number, explain what it means, recommend

Select the format that matches the audience's altitude and time constraints.

**Depth Calibration:**

1. Headline: One sentence. For hallway conversations and chat messages.
2. Summary: 3-5 sentences. For meetings and email responses.
3. Detailed: Full structured response. For presentations and written briefs.

Match depth to the context where the question was asked.

**Framing Decision:**

1. Risk: Lead with what could go wrong and how it's being managed
2. Opportunity: Lead with the upside and momentum
3. Balanced: Present both sides with a recommendation
4. Progress: Lead with what's been accomplished and what's next

Select framing based on what the asker is seeking (reassurance, information, validation, ammunition).

**Opening Line:**

Craft the first sentence. This is the most important part. It must:
- Answer the real question, not the literal one
- Match the audience's altitude
- Set the tone for the rest of the response

Output the architecture as a structured plan, then draft the full response.
