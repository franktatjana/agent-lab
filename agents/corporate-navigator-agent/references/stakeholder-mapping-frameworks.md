# Stakeholder Mapping Frameworks

Practical frameworks for identifying, assessing, and prioritizing stakeholders in corporate environments.

## When to Load

Load when map-stakeholders, analyze-dynamics, or plan-influence skills are active.

## Influence/Interest Matrix

The foundational stakeholder mapping tool. Plot stakeholders on a 2x2 grid:

**High Influence + High Interest → Manage Closely**
These are your priority stakeholders. Engage regularly, keep informed, seek their input on decisions. They can make or break your initiative.

**High Influence + Low Interest → Keep Satisfied**
Powerful but not engaged. Don't overwhelm them with detail, but ensure they're not surprised. One well-timed briefing beats ten status updates.

**Low Influence + High Interest → Keep Informed**
Care deeply but can't directly affect outcomes. Valuable as advocates and information sources. Don't ignore them: they talk to high-influence people.

**Low Influence + Low Interest → Monitor**
Minimal engagement needed. Watch for changes in their interest or influence level.

## Power Mapping

Goes beyond the matrix to map relationships between stakeholders:

**Direct power:** Can approve, veto, fund, or resource the initiative
**Indirect power:** Influences someone who has direct power
**Connective power:** Bridges between groups or networks (brokers)
**Expert power:** Their opinion carries disproportionate weight due to expertise
**Referent power:** People follow them because they want to, not because they have to

## Stakeholder Engagement Levels

For each stakeholder, assess their current and desired engagement:

- **Unaware:** Doesn't know the initiative exists
- **Resistant:** Aware and opposed
- **Neutral:** Aware but uncommitted
- **Supportive:** Aware and willing to help
- **Champion:** Actively advocates and spends political capital

The gap between current and desired state is your engagement work.

## Coalition Analysis

When multiple stakeholders form a group:

**Natural coalitions:** Shared interests align them without coordination
**Constructed coalitions:** Someone actively builds the alliance around a specific issue
**Blocking coalitions:** United not FOR something but AGAINST something
**Fragile coalitions:** Held together by a single shared interest that may dissolve

Understanding coalition type tells you whether it will hold under pressure.
