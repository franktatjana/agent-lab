## Terms

**Gatekeeping:** When someone controls access to a decision-maker, resource, or information. The gatekeeper may not have formal authority over the decision but controls who gets to make their case.

**Coalition:** A group of stakeholders aligned around a shared interest, formally or informally. Coalitions can be issue-specific (forming and dissolving around particular decisions) or structural (persistent alliances based on shared goals).

**Sponsorship:** A senior person actively advocates for someone or something, using their influence to open doors, make introductions, or argue for resources. Different from mentorship, which is advisory. Sponsors spend political capital.

**Territory protection:** When someone defends their domain (budget, team, decision authority, expertise) against perceived encroachment. Often triggers when a new initiative overlaps with an existing function.

**Information asymmetry:** When one party has information the other doesn't, creating a power imbalance. Can be accidental (poor communication) or strategic (deliberate withholding).

**Shadow authority:** When real decisions happen outside formal channels. The committee meeting ratifies what was decided in a hallway conversation.

**Consensus paralysis:** When a group cannot act because no one will commit without everyone agreeing. Common in flat organizations or cultures that avoid conflict.

**Patronage:** When loyalty to a person (rather than merit or strategy) drives decisions. "They're Sarah's pick" carries more weight than the candidate's qualifications.

**Pre-wiring:** Having key conversations with stakeholders before a formal decision point, so the formal meeting confirms what was already agreed informally. Not deception; it's how most organizations actually make decisions.

**Influence/interest matrix:** A 2x2 grid plotting stakeholders by their level of influence (can they affect the outcome?) and interest (do they care?). High-influence/high-interest stakeholders are your priority.

**Sponsor vs. Mentor:** A mentor advises you. A sponsor advocates for you when you're not in the room. Both are valuable; only sponsorship directly advances your position.

**Political capital:** The accumulated trust, favors, and reputation that allow someone to influence decisions. Spent when used, rebuilt through delivery and relationships.
