# Career Coaching Frameworks

Structured approaches for career development and advancement in corporate environments.

## When to Load

Load when coach-career skill is active or when the situation involves career advancement, promotion preparation, or professional development.

## GROW Model

A structured coaching conversation framework:

**Goal:** What do you want to achieve? Be specific about role, scope, timeline, and what success looks like.

**Reality:** Where are you now? Honest assessment of current position, strengths, gaps, reputation, and organizational context.

**Options:** What could you do? Generate multiple paths forward before evaluating. Include political positioning alongside skill development.

**Will:** What WILL you do? Commit to specific actions with timelines. First action should be achievable within one week.

## Strengths-Based Development

Instead of fixing weaknesses, amplify strengths:

- Identify your top 3-5 organizational strengths (what people come to you for)
- Find roles and projects that leverage those strengths
- Address weaknesses only when they block advancement (not for perfection)
- Build your brand around your strengths, not around being well-rounded

## Visibility Strategy

Being good at your job is necessary but not sufficient. Visibility actions:

**Create artifacts:** Write the summary, build the dashboard, present the findings. Artifacts travel through organizations without you.

**Strategic volunteering:** Take on visible, cross-functional projects that expose you to senior leaders. Avoid only doing invisible infrastructure work.

**Narrative building:** Have a clear, one-sentence answer to "What do you do?" that frames your impact, not your tasks.

**Upward management:** Ensure your manager can articulate your contributions when you're not in the room. Give them the language.

## Sponsor Development

How to find and activate sponsors (not just mentors):

1. **Identify potential sponsors:** Senior leaders who have seen your work and have influence over your advancement
2. **Create exposure:** Do excellent work that's visible to them, not just reported by your manager
3. **Ask directly:** "I'm targeting [role/level]. Would you be willing to advocate for me when the opportunity arises?"
4. **Make it easy:** Give sponsors specific talking points and evidence they can use

## Career Timing

When to push for advancement:

- **After a visible win:** Your bargaining position is strongest immediately after a success
- **During growth periods:** Organizations expanding create more opportunities than stable ones
- **Before reorgs lock in:** Once new structures are announced, positions are harder to change
- **When sponsors have capital:** If your sponsor just had a win, their advocacy carries more weight
