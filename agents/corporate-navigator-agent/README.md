# Corporate Navigator Agent

## The Human Analogy

The trusted colleague who's been at the company for 15 years and can tell you how things *really* work. Not the org chart, not the process document, but who actually makes decisions, which meetings matter, and why your proposal keeps getting blocked. Part political analyst, part career advisor, part organizational anthropologist.

## Value Proposition

Most professionals are technically competent but politically unaware. They present strong proposals that die in committee, watch less qualified peers get promoted, and can't explain why reorganizations land the way they do. The Corporate Navigator makes invisible dynamics visible:

- Unnamed political patterns become named, actionable dynamics
- "I don't know why this got blocked" becomes a specific stakeholder map with engagement strategy
- Career advancement stops depending on luck and starts depending on informed positioning

## How to Use

**Map before you move.** Before proposing a new initiative:
```
Input: your org context, the initiative, key stakeholders
Skill: Map Stakeholders
Output: stakeholder map with engagement priorities
```

**Read the room.** When something political happened and you can't explain it:
```
Input: what happened, who was involved, what surprised you
Skill: Analyze Dynamics
Output: named dynamics (gatekeeping, coalition, territory protection) with implications
```

**Plan your approach.** When you need buy-in from multiple stakeholders:
```
Input: your goal, key players, constraints, timeline
Skill: Plan Influence
Output: sequenced engagement plan with talking points per stakeholder
```

**Advance your career.** When you're preparing for a promotion or feeling stuck:
```
Input: your role, career goal, timeline, strengths, blockers
Skill: Career Coach
Personality: Coach
Output: development plan combining skills, visibility, and sponsor strategy
```

## What's Possible

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Stakeholder mapping | Available |
| Political dynamics analysis | Available |
| Ethical influence planning | Available |
| Career coaching (GROW) | Available |
| Situational navigation | Available |
| Multi-agent handoff to Culture Agent | Planned |
| Organizational network visualization | Planned |

## Multi-Agent Combinations

- **Corporate Navigator → Culture Agent**: When workplace dynamics involve cross-cultural dimensions (international teams, global organizations)
- **Corporate Navigator → Why Agent**: When you need to understand the root cause of a political pattern, not just navigate it
- **Corporate Navigator → Question Decoder Agent**: When the challenge shifts from understanding the landscape to framing your response for a specific audience
- **Corporate Navigator → Six Hats Agent**: When a stakeholder decision needs structured multi-perspective analysis

## Case Study

**The Blocked Proposal**: A Product Director navigates stakeholder resistance to get a B2B product initiative approved after two committee rejections. [Full case study](case-studies/the-blocked-proposal.md)

## Problem

Organizational politics are real but rarely taught. People lose promotions, proposals, and opportunities not because they lack competence but because they don't understand how decisions really get made. This gap disproportionately affects people who aren't naturally political, including many high-performing technical professionals.

## Goals

- Make organizational power dynamics visible and understandable
- Provide ethical, actionable strategies (not manipulation tactics)
- Help users navigate specific situations with concrete next steps
- Support career development with political awareness

## Non-Goals

- Legal, HR, or compliance advice
- Encouraging manipulation or deception
- Replacing professional career coaches for major life decisions
- Providing therapy or mental health support

## Use Cases

- **Product leaders** navigating cross-functional buy-in for new initiatives
- **Engineers** preparing for promotion in politically complex organizations
- **New employees** understanding the unwritten rules of a new workplace
- **Managers** dealing with stakeholder resistance to team changes
- **Individual contributors** who are technically strong but politically unaware

## Ideas

- Integration with org chart data for automated stakeholder pre-mapping
- Pattern library of common corporate dynamics with playbooks
- Longitudinal tracking of stakeholder positions across multiple sessions
- Workshop mode for team-based political landscape analysis

## Roadmap

**Phase 1 (current):** Core skills (stakeholder mapping, dynamics analysis, influence planning, career coaching, situation navigation)

**Phase 2:** Reference expansion (industry-specific political patterns, organizational archetypes), multi-agent handoffs

**Phase 3:** Interactive stakeholder visualization, session memory for ongoing situations

## Open Questions

- Should the agent track stakeholder positions across sessions (memory)?
- How to handle situations where the user is the problem (their behavior is creating the political friction)?
- Integration with Culture Agent for organizations with strong national/regional culture dynamics

## Success Criteria

- Political dynamic is named, not vaguely described
- Stakeholder map distinguishes formal power from informal influence
- Recommendations are sequenced and specific (not generic career advice)
- Users report understanding their situation better after using the agent
- No manipulation tactics or unethical suggestions in any output
