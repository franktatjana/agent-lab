  landscape_summary: >
    Territory protection from product teams who fear losing stack autonomy,
    counterbalanced by CTO sponsorship for consolidation. VP Engineering
    is the swing vote: will support if you can prove no delivery disruption.

  blind_spots:
    - "Team Lead C and D not mentioned. If either is vocal, they could form a blocking coalition with Lead A."
    - "Finance stakeholders not mapped. If consolidation requires significant investment, CFO engagement needed."

  confidence: "medium"
  caveats:
    - "Matrix organizations create dual-reporting dynamics. Check if product leads have dotted-line influence through VP Product."
