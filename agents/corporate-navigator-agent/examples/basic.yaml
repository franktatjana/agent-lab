# Simplest valid input demonstrating core stakeholder navigation

input:
  organization_context: "Mid-size tech company, 500 people, flat culture"
  your_role: "Senior Product Manager, 2 years tenure"
  situation: "Proposing a new product line to leadership"
  key_stakeholders: "VP Engineering (skeptical), CTO (supportive), CFO (cost-focused)"

output:
  landscape: >
    Classic sponsorship dynamic. You have a senior champion (CTO) but face
    a gatekeeper (VP Engineering) whose skepticism could stall the proposal.
    The CFO will follow whoever builds the stronger business case.
  key_players:
    - name: "VP Engineering"
      interest: "Protect team bandwidth"
      influence: "high"
      stance: "opposed"
    - name: "CTO"
      interest: "Strategic product expansion"
      influence: "highest"
      stance: "supportive"
    - name: "CFO"
      interest: "ROI clarity"
      influence: "moderate"
      stance: "undecided"
  recommendations:
    - "Pre-wire the VP Engineering: 1-on-1 to address bandwidth concerns before the formal pitch"
    - "Arm your sponsor: give the CTO a one-page brief for informal advocacy"
    - "Lead with numbers for the CFO: frame as revenue opportunity with phased investment"
  risk: >
    If VP Engineering raises concerns publicly before private resolution,
    the CFO will side with caution. Pre-wire first.

  confidence: "high"
  caveats:
    - "Flat culture means informal conversations carry more weight than formal proposals"
    - "VP Engineering's skepticism may be about bandwidth, not the idea itself"
