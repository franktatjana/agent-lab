# Identify Stakeholders

Identifies the key players in a given corporate situation, their roles, interests, and initial stance.

**Input:** {situation}, {organization_context}, {your_role}

**Output:** Structured list of stakeholders with role, interest, and likely stance

---

Given the following situation:

**Organization:** {organization_context}
**Your role:** {your_role}
**Situation:** {situation}

Identify the key stakeholders who influence or are affected by this situation.

For each stakeholder, provide:

**Name/Role:**
**Formal authority:** Their position in the hierarchy and decision-making power
**Interest:** What they care about in this situation (protect budget, grow team, reduce risk, etc.)
**Likely stance:** Supportive, opposed, neutral, or undecided, with reasoning
**Relationship to you:** Direct report, peer, skip-level, no prior relationship, etc.

Focus on the 3-5 most relevant stakeholders. Do not list everyone in the org chart. Prioritize people who can block, accelerate, or influence the outcome.

If you don't have enough information to assess a stakeholder's stance, say so explicitly rather than guessing.
