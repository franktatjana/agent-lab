# Assess Influence

Maps the formal authority and informal influence of identified stakeholders.

**Input:** {stakeholders}, {organization_context}

**Output:** Influence assessment distinguishing formal power from informal networks

---

For each of the following stakeholders in {organization_context}:

{stakeholders}

Assess their influence across two dimensions:

**Formal authority:**
- Decision-making power (can they approve, veto, or fund?)
- Organizational position (reporting level, committee memberships)
- Resource control (budget, headcount, technology)

**Informal influence:**
- Network centrality (who listens to them regardless of title?)
- Track record (history of getting things done or blocking them)
- Relationship capital (who owes them favors, who trusts their judgment?)
- Cultural influence (do they set norms, define "how things work here"?)

Rate each stakeholder:
- **Formal authority:** High / Medium / Low
- **Informal influence:** High / Medium / Low
- **Net influence:** The combined effect on this specific situation

Flag any cases where formal authority and informal influence diverge significantly. These mismatches are often where political dynamics become most complex.
