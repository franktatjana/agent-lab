Given this corporate situation:

**Organization:** {organization_context}
**Situation:** {situation}
**Stakeholders:** {stakeholders_with_influence}

Name the political dynamics at play. Use specific terms:

- **Gatekeeping:** Someone controls access to a decision-maker or resource
- **Coalition:** A group is aligned (formally or informally) around a shared interest
- **Sponsorship:** A senior person actively advocates for someone or something
- **Territory protection:** Someone defends their domain against perceived encroachment
- **Information asymmetry:** Someone has (or controls) information others need
- **Patronage:** Loyalty to a person rather than an idea drives decisions
- **Consensus paralysis:** No one will act without everyone agreeing
- **Shadow authority:** Real decisions happen outside formal channels

For each dynamic you identify:

**Dynamic:** Name it
**Who is involved:** Which stakeholders are driving or affected by it
**How it manifests:** What observable behavior reveals this dynamic
**Implication for you:** How this affects the user's ability to achieve their goal

Do not list dynamics that aren't supported by the information provided. If the situation is ambiguous, present the two most likely interpretations.
