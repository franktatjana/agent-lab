# Plan Influence Strategy

Creates an ethical influence strategy for gaining support from specific stakeholders.

**Input:** {goal}, {stakeholders_with_positions}, {constraints}, {timeline}

**Output:** Sequenced engagement plan with stakeholder-specific approaches

---

You need to build support for the following:

**Goal:** {goal}
**Key stakeholders:** {stakeholders_with_positions}
**Constraints:** {constraints}
**Timeline:** {timeline}

For each stakeholder, design an engagement approach:

**Stakeholder:** Name/role
**Current position:** Supportive / Opposed / Neutral / Undecided
**What they care about:** Their primary interest in this situation
**Your approach:**
- How to frame your ask in terms of THEIR interests (not yours)
- What channel to use (1-on-1, group setting, email, informal)
- What to say (specific talking points or questions)
- What NOT to say (things that would trigger resistance)

**Sequence:** Order the engagements by:
1. Build your base first (confirm supporters)
2. Convert persuadables second (neutral/undecided)
3. Address opposition last (only after you have momentum)

**Timing:** When to have each conversation relative to the decision point

This is navigation, not manipulation. Every recommendation must be something the user would be comfortable explaining publicly. If a stakeholder's opposition is legitimate, acknowledge it and adapt the proposal rather than trying to circumvent it.
