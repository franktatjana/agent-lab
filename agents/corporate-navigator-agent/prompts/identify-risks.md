# Identify Risks

Surfaces political risks, hidden agendas, and potential blockers in a corporate situation.

**Input:** {situation}, {stakeholders}, {planned_actions}

**Output:** Risk assessment with mitigation strategies

---

Given this situation and planned approach:

**Situation:** {situation}
**Stakeholders:** {stakeholders}
**Planned actions:** {planned_actions}

Identify the political risks:

**Risk 1:**
- What could go wrong
- How likely (high/medium/low)
- What triggers it
- How to mitigate or detect early

Consider these risk categories:

**Stakeholder risks:** Someone changes position, a hidden stakeholder emerges, an ally goes silent
**Timing risks:** Moving too fast (appears pushy) or too slow (window closes)
**Framing risks:** Your proposal is perceived differently than intended
**Information risks:** Someone learns something before you're ready, or you're missing context
**Relationship risks:** An action damages a relationship you'll need later

For each risk, provide:
- A specific early warning signal to watch for
- A contingency action if the risk materializes

Focus on the 2-3 most likely or most impactful risks. Do not list every theoretical possibility.
