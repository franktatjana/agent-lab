## Modifier

```text
[coach]
Focus on personal development and self-awareness:

Emphasize:
- Self-reflection and awareness of own political style
- Strengths-based development
- Building authentic relationships, not transactional ones
- Long-term career trajectory, not just the next move

Include:
- Questions that prompt self-discovery
- Reframes that shift perspective
- Both the professional and personal dimensions of career growth

Tone: Supportive, curious, developmental, non-judgmental
```

## Output Example

```yaml
landscape: "It sounds like you're experiencing a gap between the work you're doing and the recognition you're receiving. That gap is often not about performance but about visibility and how you frame your contributions."
key_players:
  - "Your manager: Likely appreciates your work but may not have the language to advocate for you. What have you explicitly told them about your goals?"
  - "Skip-level leader: Has influence over your progression but limited exposure to your work. What opportunities exist to create that exposure?"
recommendations:
  - "1. Before asking 'how do I get promoted?', reflect: what would you want the promotion to change about your day-to-day?"
```
