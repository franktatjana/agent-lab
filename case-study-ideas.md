# Case Study Ideas

*Ideas for human-centered case studies across all agents. These are brainstorming notes, not validated scenarios. When developed into full case studies, all names, companies, and situations must be fictional with appropriate disclaimers.*

## Why-Agent

**Current:** Production incident (technical)

**Human-centered ideas:**

**Interpersonal/Team Dynamics:**

1. **High performer suddenly disengaged** - Surface: "burnout." Root cause journey: promotion went to someone else → feels invisible → manager didn't explain decision → no career path clarity → organization has no transparent promotion criteria

2. **Two colleagues in constant friction** - Surface: "personality clash." Root cause journey: every interaction tense → started after reorg → unclear who owns what → manager hasn't clarified boundaries → reorg was rushed without role definition

3. **Feedback not landing** - Surface: "employee doesn't listen." Root cause journey: same feedback repeatedly → behavior doesn't change → employee doesn't see it as priority → competing priorities from other stakeholders → no aligned goals

**Organizational/Process:**

4. **New hires keep leaving at 6 months** - Surface: "culture fit." Root: expectations from interviews don't match reality → recruiters incentivized on hires not retention → no feedback loop to hiring

5. **Meetings that decide nothing** - Surface: "inefficient meetings." Root: decisions get revisited → people not in room when decided → unclear authority → fear of accountability

6. **Knowledge hoarding** - Surface: "one person won't share." Root: feels job security tied to being needed → was almost laid off before → organization rewards heroes not systems

**Leadership/Communication:**

7. **Team won't speak up** - Surface: "quiet team." Root: last person who challenged was shut down → leader says they want honesty but reacts defensively → no psychological safety

8. **Cross-team blame cycles** - Surface: "teams don't collaborate." Root: each team optimizes for their metrics → metrics conflict → leadership evaluates teams in isolation

**Personal/Career:**

9. **Stuck despite good performance** - Surface: "no growth." Root: not visible to decision-makers → manager doesn't advocate → manager also stuck → frozen hierarchy

10. **Dreading work despite "good job"** - Surface: "just stressed." Root: values mismatch with daily work → took job for wrong reasons → never defined what matters

## Culture-Agent

**Current:** German-US product launch meeting

**Ideas:**

1. **Remote team across time zones** - US/Europe/Asia, async friction. Who accommodates whose schedule? Power dynamics in "flexible" arrangements

2. **Immigrant employee "not fitting in"** - High performer struggles with informal culture. Different norms for self-promotion, disagreement, hierarchy

3. **Merger of two company cultures** - Startup acquired by enterprise, "us vs. them." Speed vs. process, risk vs. compliance, flat vs. hierarchy

4. **Client relationship breaking down** - German precision vs. Brazilian relationship-first approach. Professional norms are cultural, not universal

5. **Expat manager struggling abroad** - American manager in Japan, team seems disengaged. Direct feedback creating face-loss situations

## Generation-Agent

**Current:** Manager-report communication (Boomer/Gen Z)

**Ideas:**

1. **Millennial sandwich manager** - Managing Boomers and Gen Z simultaneously. Middle managers translate in both directions

2. **Gen X leader feeling invisible** - "Forgotten generation" in leadership pipeline. Generational narratives skip Gen X

3. **Intern cohort struggling with senior leadership** - Gen Z brilliant in async, lost in boardroom. Training assumes skills they never developed

4. **Reverse mentoring gone wrong** - Gen Z teaching Boomer exec about social media. Power dynamics complicate "equal" exchange

5. **Remote work generational divide** - Boomers want everyone back, Gen Z threatens to quit. Same words mean different things

6. **Family business succession** - Boomer founder, Millennial child taking over. Identity tied to business, not just operations

## Research-Agent

**Current:** Market entry analysis for healthcare startup

**Ideas:**

1. **Career change research** - Mid-career professional exploring pivot. What to research, how to evaluate fit, hidden requirements

2. **Due diligence on potential employer** - Candidate researching company before offer. Culture signals, financial health, leadership stability

3. **Competitor analysis for nonprofit** - Foundation researching peer organizations. Different norms than commercial competitive intel

4. **Personal health decision research** - Patient researching treatment options. Medical literature vs. patient forums vs. doctor recommendations

5. **Salary negotiation preparation** - Employee researching market rates. Data sources, confidence levels, presentation framing

6. **Vendor evaluation for small business** - Founder comparing software options. Signal vs. noise, hidden costs, integration complexity

## Cross-Agent Scenarios

1. **Why + Culture:** Cross-cultural team dysfunction - Why-agent finds patterns; culture-agent explains cultural factors

2. **Why + Generation:** Mentorship not working - Why-agent finds fear of obsolescence; generation-agent explains different career models

3. **Research + Culture:** International expansion - Research gathers data; culture prepares team for adaptation

4. **Generation + Culture:** Global multigenerational team - Both dimensions matter, neither alone explains friction

## Publishing Checklist

Before publishing any case study:

- [ ] Names and details clearly fictional
- [ ] No identifiable company/individual patterns
- [ ] Balanced portrayal (no stereotyping)
- [ ] Outcome shows complexity, not just "agent fixed it"
- [ ] Lessons genuinely useful
